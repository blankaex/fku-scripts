Why are Yurikawa and Niguredou here?
?
I thought I was going to be alone with Miko today.
Hana?
What's with the gigantic backpack?
Don't worry! It's just full of snacks!
Maintaining your blood sugar is important for studying!
You eat snacks and fill up on sugar,
and your brain will use the sugar to help you study!
Something behind me is giving me shivers...

{3}
I called everyone over to study,
{fill from prev}
but is this really okay?
There's only Kyousuke in the living room.
Now is probably okay...
{mask}

{4}
Hey, lil Kyo!
It's your big sis Hana!
Ugh it's her again...
What did you come here for?
Get back!
Just here to study.
Hey, where's mom?
She went out shopping.
Hey Kyousuke,
is it all right if we study in the living room?
Aw, c'mon!
I'm in the middle of a game!

{5}
Can't you just study in your room?
It's so cramped up there, though.
All right, fine.
peek
Miko's brother?
Hello—
What's a grade schooler doing here?
Wanna play Murio Kart?
Julia's a high schooler.
Fuck this kid!
Don't get all uppity just cause you're Miko's sister!
I'm way ahead of you in terms of power, and... stuff...
I bet I'm taller, too...

{6}
Hello.
...
She's so long!
Damn, you're so cool!
So long!
Michiru is a model!
Wow, you're famous?
Have you been on Totally Freaky?{check name}
I haven't.
What's Totally Freaky?

{7}
What was that?
Oh...
SORRY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL GO TO MY ROOM.
Huh, why? Do you have enough room?
I can just move some things around...
...

{8}
There's something there...
clack

{9}
Time to put Godmother's prayer beads to use!
What did you eat to get that tall?
MD's! Especially the—
Wasn't asking you, Hana.

Hey!
That's the wrong way, Julia!

Quite a crowd we have over today!

{13}
How fun.
Hahaha
It's great to have lots of friends.
Miko, why are you strangling Julia?
Huh? Oh, sorry! Force of habit!
Wait, are you okay?
I guess she wants me to ask permission before exorcising...
I'm okay...

{14}
Why did you come out today, Dad?
huff
Miko sure gets around, huh?
You're always in the tatami room!
But you're my only friend.
Hahaha, just kidding!
...

{15}
Hana, could you take Julia and Michiru up to my room?
I'll pour us some drinks.
Hmm?
Let me help!
It's fine! You're my guests!
Why don't you just study down here?
...
What's with the scary look?{nice bubble}
Ever since I started seeing them,
he's been sitting at home.
I'm already used to Dad being there.

{16}
Maybe "used to" isn't the right phrasing.
Goodnight, Miko.
Miko won't listen to me...
Give her some time.
I used to always ignore him when we got into a fight.
It's a bit late in the game but I still don't know how I'm meant to act.
And then there's that...
It's always with him.
huff
It doesn't look like it's going to do anything,
but I don't think it would be a good idea to let Michiru's tentacles get too close.

{17}
Miko.
I brought you a gift.
It's a pudding.
Bewitching richness
Pudding
Sloppy and delicious
You like these, right?
Oh no.

Huh?
They retracted?
What's wrong Miko?
Huh? Oh!
Nothing! I'm fine!
Thanks for the pudding.
You're welcome.

{24}
Could you wait up in my room?
I'll join you guys soon.
Are you sure you'll be okay?
I'll be fine!
All right, we'll see you soon.
Yeah.

Greedy boy, aren't we?
You could've just stayed down here.
...

{25}
That scared the heck out of me... I thought Dad was dead for sure...
aaaahhhh
What's wrong?
Needa poop?
I mean, he's already dead, but you know...
It's just...
It wouldn't feel right.

Hey Michiru, hold up!
You haven't been over before, right?
I'll show you where Miko's room—
Huh?
Have you been over before?
...
No.
Intuition?
It was just a coincidence, without a moment of hesitation.
