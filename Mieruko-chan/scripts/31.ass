Hana
I caught a cold, might skip school today
So dead rabbit
31
Did you hear? Hana's out sick.
Yeah.
I didn't think she'd be the type to get sick.
Apparently she jumped into the river yesterday.
What? Why?
I dunno, she does stuff like that sometimes.
Right...
She doesn't seem like the type to get sick, but she _does_ seem like the type to jump into a river.
I hope she's okay.
Hana's counter-intuitive ecology.

ding
Oh, it's Hana.
Hana
So... Hungry... No more... Porridge...

{3}
What the heck is that?
Wow, she looks terrible.
Her aura's a lot weaker too.
Huh?
Her aura?
I'm not surprised all your life aura was used up,
Sorry...
Umm...
I'm so hungry... I can't move...
May I go to the infirmary?
Wait, Hana's vulnerable right now!
What if that thing attacks her?

{4}
What's going to happen to her?
I gotta go!
Huh? Whaâ€”
Wait!

{5}
Wow!
You really didn't have to come!
I said I'd be fine!
How are you feeling?
My temperature's gone down a bunch!
I'm still a bit wobbly though.
This is my first time coming over to a friend's house...{cute}
RUMBLE
Ah...

{6}
My stomach's rumbling again...
Anyway, come in.
Th-Thanks...

{7}
Thanks for the apples!
Mom went out to buy ingredients for dinner.
My hunger was probably going to get me before the cold did!
I'm glad you still have your appetite.
peel
peel
Does she even need to peel it for her?
Man I feel great after getting some food in my belly!
Oh, her aura's back.

{8}
glub
glub
It's clearly after Hana...
What do I do?

{9}
It's amazing how fast her aura came back after she had something to eat.
I wonder how it works.

{10}
Oh sorry, I should make you guys some tea or something huh?
One sec...
It's fine! Just stay put, Hana!
We'll make the tea.
wink
Y-Yeah.
...
Hey, I wanted to ask about Hana's aura.
D-Don't worry, I'll keep it a secret!
It's amazing, though.
It recovers straight away after she eats.
Her aura's back? Thank goodness...
Huh?

{11}
Her aura is fading away again.
Hana! Have some more apples!
Whoa!
Okay!

{12}
Oh, it's back.
...
glub
glub
...
Phew.
!
Julia! Her aura's dwindling again isn't it?
Huh? I-Is it?
I don't think it is...
I'm kinda hungry...
But kinda not hungry...

{13}
I can't tell what the problem is.
Is it because she's sick, or is it because of that thing?
Hey, Julia?
Could you do me a favor?
Just give me a sign if you see Hana's aura fading.
wink
!
Huh? What?
A sign?
Is this some kind of ritual?
Here you go Hana, we made you some ginger tea.
Huh? Melon soda?
Ginger tea.
That wasn't even close.
This warms me right up.

{14}


{15}
{mask}
You can keep it.
I have a feeling you'll be needing it.
I should've brought that stone.
Actually, I don't even know if it works or not.
What if it has the opposite effect?
Here Hana, have some apple.
I guess I'll have to do what I can to keep her aura full.
glance
Her Aura's looking fine.
Why does she want me to do this anyway?

{16}
Could it be...
I see three of them!
A spiritual eyesight test?
Could you do me a favor?
Just give me a sign if you see Hana's aura fading.
wink
Is she testing me to see how well I can make out Hana's aura while her cold's making it unstable?{both lines}
It doesn't look like it's about to do anything.
I hope it'll just get bored and go away.

{17}
snap
squeeze
Could you do me a favor?
Just give me a sign if you see Hana's aura fading.
wink
The sign!
And she's so bad at winking!{cute}

{18}
It's tangling her up in its hair!
Hana!
Hmm?

{19}
Eat up.

{20}
Mmf...
Phew...
I ate way too much...
{mask the 2 small ones}
I'm starting to feel a little hot...
How's her aura?

{21}
It looks pretty weakened after getting hit by Hana's aura.
glub
glub
glub
Looks like we're safe for now...
Gosh, it's so hot.
I need to let some air in.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.
Do you two have some time after this?
Huh?

{22,23}


{24}


{25}
glub
Wow, the wind is crazy!
What's going on?
I'm getting dizzy...
Hana!

{26,27}


{28}


{29}
Ngh...
Hana, are you okay?
Her aura is getting weaker...
They followed me all the way here?
Huh?

{30}
ring ring
Miko...
Could you get that?
beep
Hello?
Hi, Enlightened Sushi!
I have your order.

{31}
I told Mom that you two were coming over, so she ordered sushi for us.
I totally forgot to tell you!
I'm glad it arrived in time, though!
I feel so much better after some sushi!
Whoa...
Come on, have some!

{32}


{33}
They were definitely after Hana.
Is it because we were at the shrine together?
The big one was there too.
It left pretty quickly, though.
I don't think I can get away with just ignoring it.
I might have to go see Godmother to get some more advice.
Sorry, Miko.
I failed, didn't I?{holy speech bubble}
If only I was able to see her aura more clearly...
I would've been able to do something before she fell...
I'm not cut out for this...

{34}
What are you talking about?
I don't know what would have happened without you.
You were amazing.
Thanks so much for the help.
H-Hmph...
I'll lend you my powers if I must...
Oh, she's trying to wink.
Still can't do it.
"You're welcome" wink successfully failed.
