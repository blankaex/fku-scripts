Well it was worth a shot, but it looks like the storm shutters are locked from the outside.
I suppose I could shout for help. Someone is bound to notice if I make enough noise.
But if I did that, then she'd definitely get to me first.
Then she might just bare her "fangs".

!
Is this food?
I-I don't really have much of an appetite.

03
Just eat.
All right...
There's just yoghurt, jelly, and some vitamins on the menu.
It's not like I have a fever or anything...

It's really hard to eat while she's staring daggers into my back...
She must really want to make sure that I'm eating everything.
Though I suppose this is for the best.
I don't remember much from before I was locked up, but I don't think I took very good care of myself.
I'm not confident I'd be able to stomach much more than this.
