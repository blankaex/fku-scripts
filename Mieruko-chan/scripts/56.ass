There's a Lambda Rabbit event on New Year's!
Oh yeah?
They're giving out Light-up Lambda Rabbits!
That's cool.
By the way, when are you going to let go of my hands?
Never! Your hands are so warm!
But I'm cold...
Get a room!
Come on, we should go! It'll be during Winter vacation!
Sure, I guess.
I knew you wanted the Light-up Lambda Rabbit!
Not really...
You two are having fun.
Last day of school.

Good Morning.
Miko.
Whoa...
H-Hey!

Morning, Michiru!

{3}
Cold out today, huh?
...
Phew, she's rocking a pretty cute look today.
I'm glad I can finally see her face now.
But her tentacles have been sprouting all over the place.
Miko.
pfft
Miko.
eek
That's also pretty hard to deal with in its own right.

...
Oh!
Michiru, are you free on New Year's?
Do you want a Light-up Lambda Rabbit?
Absolutely not.
Huh? No way!
Not in the slightest.
...

{5}
I wonder what happened in the gym storage room.
Hana and Michiru have been closer (?) ever since.
Julia!
Wait, Hana!
Morning!
M—
Mo—
Huh?
What?!

{6}
Do you want a Light-up Lambda Rabbit?
What?
Rabbit?
No.
I'm asking Julia!
Is this some kind of ritual?
Heh.
Ahem.
Good morning.
It's time to head back to class.
Morning, Mr. Zen!

{7}
They said the snow's going to get heavier in the evening.
Let me under your umbrella!
Later!
See you next year!
Sure you don't want a lift home (Miko)?
Don't worry about it, our houses are all over the place!
Thanks, but I'm gonna pick up Kyousuke today.
Oh.

{8}
It would've been fun to go home together.
Whoa!
See you! I'll text you later!
Bye.

Didn't you just down five buns?
The snow's really coming down.

Miko!
What are you doing here?
You didn't bring an umbrella right?
I thought I'd come pick you up.
Huh? Kyousuke, that's your sister?
What of it?
Hello.
Your friend?
Oh,
Hello.
Bro, your sister's hot.
Eyes elsewhere, nerd!
Are you Kyousuke's friend too?
Y-Yeah...

Want some red bean soup?
It'll warm you up.
Sure, if you want some.

Y'know, Hana wouldn't let go of my hand all day.
She was using me like a pocket heater!
Sounds like her.
Wanna hold hands?
It'll warm you up.
Ew.
No way.

Slipped a bit there.

Weird, it felt like I was being pulled.

What do I do?
Kyousuke's in trouble!
I can't do anything by myself...
Kyousuke, drop that snowman!
Huh?
Just drop it!
Y'know... Snow can be kinda gross!

{20}
Huh?
That's weird.

Whoa, Miko!
Slow down!
Can't!
Hold on tight, Kyousuke!
You might've broken your leg!
What?
We need to hurry home!{stick}
Something was up with that snowman.
I don't know what exactly.
It might've been like the bells from the shrine.
Something you're not supposed to touch.

{28}
Haa
Haa
Haa
What was that about, Miko?
Why were you so—
Kyousuke!
If you see anything... uh... weird on the street,
you'd better not touch it, okay?
S-Sure...

{29}
Anyway let me run a bath!
Don't wanna catch a cold!
Wait!
I'm not getting in with you again!
Take your clothes off already!
Stop! I can do it myself!

No.
You can't come in.

Danger signals eerily flicking on and off.
