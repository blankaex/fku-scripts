Miko Yotsuya.
Would you like a snack?
Uh...
N-No...
Thanks...
Miko's been captured by an unknown old hunk.

{02}
I'm not too fond of sweets,
but everyone insisted on ordering some.
Everyone...?

{03}
Who the heck is this guy? Or rather, who are they?
Umm...
Why does he know my name?
Oh, right!
I should introduce myself.
My name is Seto.
Just your average office worker.
Everyone calls me Mr. Seto.
Pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Seto?
And also...

{04}
Mr. Aoyama.
Mr. Oomura.
Mr. Fujioka.
Mr. Boute.
Mr. Reida.
They're all...
...great people.

{05}
Something's definitely up with this guy!
Oh!
Anyways, I need to be off—
Oh? You can't see them?
That's not what little Rommy told me.
Little Rommy?
KNOCK
KNOCK
!

{06}
Excuse me!
One mega strawberry parfait, one mango pudding parfait, one vanilla cream puff...
...one rich honey toast, and one extra spicy ramen!
Here please.
Thank you.

{07}
Let's see...
This parfait is Mr. Aoyama's,
and this one is Mr. Reida's.
Mr. Oomura was the honey toast.
The cream puff...
Mr. Fujioka's.
And the ramen was for Mr. Boute.
Oh my god...
Would you like anything?
Uh... No thanks...
Anyway, um...
Do you know Romm?

{08}
Indeed.
We've known each other for quite a while.
You know Mitsue, yes?
Oh,
yes.
Rommy used to be a shy, quiet little boy.
He would always hide behind Mitsue.
A real cutie.
You'd never be able to make eye contact with him.
...
He knows Mrs. Mitsue too.
Er...
Mr. Seto?
Are you also a medium?

{09}
Hmm...
I suppose you could say that.
As for why I'm here today...
Little Rommy asked for a favor.
{pls find}
Oh!
My photo!

{10}
W-Wait!
Romm said this photo was dangerous!
It's fine to just look at.
When investigating something of unknown nature, always make the appropriate preparations.
That was something I taught him.
Romm's a bright pupil.
So he did as he was taught.
That's why he was noticed.

{11}
I'll take care of him.
The old man in this photo.
{more flashback}
Huh?
Mr. Seto,
does he look like an old man to you too?
...
Me?

{12}
I don't see a thing.
Huh?
All I see in this photo is a girl.
I don't have the power to see anything of that nature.

{13}
Even now, in this very room.
It's just you, and me.
I don't see anything else.
...
It must be terrifying to be able to see.
Huh?
Then how—

{14}
SHIORI

{15}
I forgot!
SHIORI
MMHMM
SHIORI
SHIORI
It was still here!
MMM
Phew.
SHIORI
MMHMM
SHIORI
MMHMM
SHIORI
Miko?
Could you please open the door?
Huh? Uhh... No.
It'll be fine. Just open it a wee bit.
...

{16-17}
You sure?
You sure you sure? You sure you sure?

{18}
Shiori
Mmhmm
I-It got in!

{19}
{runes}
Excuse me, will you?
Huh? Oh, sorry...

{20}
Here?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGHHHH
Oh?
This isn't Shiori.

{21}
Oh.
A little higher?
What?
He's where it is?
NUMBER 8
SHIORI

{22-23}
!

{24}
It's on the ceiling!
What the fuck?

{25}
Found you.

{26}
Here.

{27}
NOOOOOOOOOOO

{28}
Phew.
That could've been better.
My age must be getting to me.
Ouch.
Whoa!{julia face}
Oh dear, I got blood on the floor.
That won't do.
squeak
squeak

{29}
Is your hand all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It happens all the time.
Sorry you had to see that.
I'm fine...
bzzz
Hana
What's taking so long?
You good?{the rabbit}
Oh, it's Hana.
You should head back.
Wouldn't want your friends to worry.
Huh?
But—

{30}
I'm glad we got to speak today.
You can only get so far off hearsay.
I'm on your side.
Leave it to me.

{31}
...
Thank you...
Oh!
Also,
about Romm—
Rommy is a busy boy.
I'll let him know we met.
Hey!
I found Miko!
What the heck were you doing?

{32}
Sorry, I went into the wrong room...
You're such a doofus!
We're in 17!
Let's get back to singing!
Y-Yeah...
...
She was a nice girl.
Very kind, just like Mitsue and Rommy.
Such a shame.
It pains me to have to do this.

{33}
As you all know,
tendie tower
I'm always on the side of humans.
...
Now then.
Shall we eat?
Plate cleaned.
Monster fight → food fight.
