{mask right}
It's great to see you again, Mitsue.
Thank you for coming all this way.
Good to see you're still alive and kicking.
Did you always have a dog?
Hmm? Oh.
There was a filthy little stray. I couldn't leave it on its own.
Not to mention it gave this old man something to do each day.
Right.
...
Why did Godmother come to visit her old friend?

{2}
Is something there?
Yes. It doesn't look like it'd fit in the kennel.
Oh.
Well, I usually kept it inside.
What was its name?
Oh right, I should return that to you.
That's what you're here for, right?

{3}
Here you go.
All yours.
I took good care of it.
It's still as good as new.
Thanks, I owe you one.
I'm glad it was you I left this with.
By the way...
Want to get back together?{Wait, on second read, I'm confused. Is he talking about as ghostbusting partners, or romantic partners? Changed "little Mitsue" cause I assumed the latter}
Not a chance.

{4}
Some suspicious-looking drones have been spotted nearby recently.
Make sure to keep an eye out on your way home.
What if they're trying to take creeper shots? Walk me home, Mr. Zen!
That's all for today's homeroom.
See you all tomorrow.
Straight up ignored.
As usual.
Phew, I'm hungry!
A-Are you okay, Hana?
Want some bread?
Huh?

{5}
Miko's been doting on Hana quite a bit lately.
I see what's going on here...
Come on, not so loud...
People are gonna think I'm a fatty...
I appreciate you looking after me when I was sick,
but I'm fine now! Promise!
Sorry, reflex.
Want a croquette?
Sure do!
Make sure you have something to eat if you get hungry!
Don't need to tell me twice!

She's still not back yet...
I wonder where she went. She told me to stop by if I needed anything.
I'll take care of your business with the shrine.{ch29p9 for ts reference}
You don't have to worry about a thing.
You'll be fine as long as you don't go back there.
Will we, though?
Can I just sit here and twiddle my thumbs?
What is she even going to do, anyway?
I don't know when that thing is going to show up again...

{7}
...
sigh
I'm never going to get used to this...

{8}
Me neither.
Oh!
How about some tea?

{9}
rattle{LMAO}
Super red bean soup{ch8p1; do we have raws so I can check which one?}
My treat.
...
Thanks...
This guy is pretty sketchy.
But he can see "them". He can probably see the best out of everyone I've met.

{10}
Have a seat.
Uh...
No thanks.
Miko, was it?
How is your friend Hana doing?
Fine, thanks...
He remembers our names? What a creep...
So, have there been any new developments?
You know, the whole thing with the shrine.

{11}
Huh?
You were looking for Mrs. Mitsue earlier, weren't you?{double check how he calls her pls}{Used Mrs. last chap}
Right?
H-How did—
Oh, she never told you?
I was the one who sent her this photo.
You two were in a pretty tight spot. I was worried.
!

{12}
You know about the shrine?!
Can you tell me what's going—
Whoa, calm down.
Mrs. Mitsue didn't tell you anything at all?
I've got some time.
How about we have a chat?
I don't see that mosquito, Miko.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
You'll be fine as long as you don't go back there.
Aren't they nice stones?
Very effective, as you can see.
Do I have your interest?

{13}

Good to see you again, Mitsue.
How was your trip?
Not like I was on vacation or anything.
I just went to pick something up.
Something very important.
Did anything happen while I was away?
Oh, there was one thing.

{14}
I died.
Well, it's no surprise.
Us old folk are sitting at death's door.
But even so...
It still hurts.
Rest in peace, Shige.
You'll be missed.

{15}
Anyway, your former apprentice dropped by.
He left with a black-haired girl.
!
Was it Miko?
This Miko girl has been dropping by these past few days.
That man is up to something.
I'm glad I could tell you before my time was up.
Romm...

{16}
What great weather for a trek up the mountains!
I should've brought lunch.
It's really cloudy, though...
Where's Hana?
Didn't you invite her?

{17}
Didn't I mention it the other day?
It would probably work out a lot better if she were here.
Do you want to give her a call and see—
No.
She won't be coming.
All right?
...
Miko...
I understand that you're worried about your friend,
but we have to get to the shrine first.
You can just tell her that we're going hiking, and—
And when you finish hiking?

{18}
Are you going to have a nice little picnic?
Then send her back home safely?
I told you not to come back to the mountain, Miko.
Didn't I?
Mrs. Mitsue!
...

{19}
I like your costume.
Really takes me back.
And I thought I told you to not lay a finger on these girls, Romm.
I don't recall agreeing to that.
...

{20}
Go home, Miko.
I'll take care of things here—
No.
Oh?
This is all my fault.
I took Hana to that shrine.
I'll clean up my own mess.

{21}
I'm going to the shrine.
...
What a beautiful display of friendship!
jingle
Determination.
Miko faces her fears for the sake of her best friend.
