Your shirts are as cute as ever, Kyou!
Is Miko home?
She still busy?
Weren't you guys out shopping together?
No? I was at home alone all day, baking that cake.
Hey Sis, where you headed?
Huh?
Oh, uh... I'm going shopping with Hana.
What? {lit: but she said..."}
She hasn't seen any of my messages, and she hasn't answered any of my calls either.
Weird, she always replies straight away.
I wonder what she's up to.

Are you lost?

It's the most powerful item I have!{ch6 p19}
Huh? The bracelet lady?
Didn't expect to run into you in a place like this!
Were you playing that Digimon Go or something?
That phone game all the kids are playing.
Huh? Um...
You'll only find mosquitoes around these parts!
Do you have any insect repellent? {repels in pokemon are called insect repellent}
I can lend you some.
Oh... Uh...

{20}
We're heading towards 2 o'clock.
Don't fall behind.
...
They stung me all over the place.
I really wish they'd leave me alone.
Better keep spraying.
{mask or filler line here imo}
It's not very effective, though.

{21}
This granny can see them...
pshh
They're not fond of this stuff.
Those "mosquitoes".
There are far too many mosquitoes around here.
Let's head back.
O-Okay!
pshh
The real problem is those two.
I don't know if I can do anything about them.
jingle
I'll never forget the sound of those bells.

What's going on?
I can see them much more clearly than I used to be able to.

They disappeared...
Oh, I see...
So that's what it was...

{24}
Are we on the other side of the mountain?
I think we've come far enough. We should be fine now.

{25}
Phew. I still don't feel quite alive.
U-Um...
I just came to visit the shrine...
Uh, th-there was a shrine here last time I came...
But my GPS wasn't working properly today...
And thenâ€”
Calm down, girly.
I know you're confused, but I'll explain later.
...
What's your name?
Yotsuya Miko...
Miko.

{26}
You're amazing.
So young, yet so brave.
I'm impressed.
Anyway, let's find some place to rest. I bet you're hungry.
...
You okay with Benny's?
Someone who understands.
She's not here either!
You're the only person I know who would go MD's hopping!
No way!
Let's go look somewhere else!
Okay!
Godmother is back.
