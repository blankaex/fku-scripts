All right, I'm 20 minutes early.
I'd feel pretty bad if I kept Michiru waiting.
She'd stick out like a sore thumb.
It's the End-of-Year Lambda Rabbit Fest today.
*Miko's imagination
I don't even know what kind of event it's supposed to be.
Keen for Lambda Rabbit Fest!
Ramen
Gonna grab a quick bite with Julia before we come!
Poor girl.
Miko.

Sorry for the wait.
What do you know, she does stand out.
Whoa!
You're here early.
There's still 20 minutes.
Miko.
Your Meme hoodie is very cute.
Uh, thanks.
The design on your dress is really fashionable and cu—{tlc}
Oh!
That's not a design, it was a tentacle...

{3}
Do I look weird?
Huh?
Nope!
You're super cute!
Phew!
badump
Cute?
badump
Anyway, shall we get going?
There's a lot of people.
Hana and Julia will meet us there.
Do you ride the train much, Michiru?{holy migolet}
No.
My sister doesn't like it when I do.
Is she okay with us hanging out today?
Yes, it's fine.
I promised to be inconspicuous.
So she said I could go.
Ah...
Right...

{4}
I'm looking forward to it.
The flirting rabbits festival.
ufufu
It's the Lambda Rabbit Fest.
Not that I'm an expert either.
You'll have to ask Hana.
I see.
ufufu
ufufu
She seems to be having fun.

A bunch of seats have opened up.
Shall we sit down?

And then, guess what?
You know Masaki?
He threw up!
Haha, no way!
He's attacking everyone, one by one!
You don't want to sit?
Huh?
Uh...
No...
Yeah...
You know...
Umm...

{9}
It's fine. Just stay still.
You can handle it. Just like before.
Just...
Like before...
Uh...
I don't think I can handle it!
I think it's even scarier
after experiencing it once before!

{10}
And then...
?
There's Michiru as well.
Romm said the tentacles were tightly linked with her.
What would happen to Michiru if they were dragged out by the axe?
found
bzzzz

{11}
Miko?
What's going on—
Let's move down, Michiru.
Huh?
We can make a break for it while he's still a few rows away.
Where are we going?
Uhh...
Just to the next car...
Umm...
I think I saw Anaconda Anaguma!
So I wanted to say hi!
Ana—
What?

{12}
Holy shit!
He's fast!

Mi—
Whoa!

Gosh!

{14}
S-Sorry.
The train shook...
Miko just...
Pushed me down...
It's fine.
Huh?
Shit, I slept past my stop.

{15}
Looks like it prioritizes people who are moving.
...
I'm gonna be late for work.
What do I do?
Next stop, ___.

The doors on the right side will open.

Doors now closing.
Please mind the closing doors.
Wait...
It won't attack people who alight?

Miko—
I've gotta protect Michiru!

Gross!

Should I press the emergency button?
Please don't.
Just a little longer...

Now departing.
Miko.
Are you okay?
Yeah...
Actually.
I'm going to find that bastard.
If it's the last thing I do.
It's fine.
By the way, can we go to Oni Qlo?
Huh?
I need some underwear...
Oh...

{35}
{whoa he subbed the station train for us this time}
Hey! Miko! Michiru!
Over here!
Wow Michiru, you look like a runway model!
Thanks...
Sorry for the wait.
Why are your eyes so puffy, Miko?
Were you crying?
So what if she was?
It was a natural phenomenon.
Michiru, please don't.

{36}
We're at the Lambda Rabbit Fest!
It's like a circus.
Whoa, seems kinda cool.
Look, they have food stalls!
Huh? Didn't you just eat before coming?
That was to prepare my stomach to eat here!
Might be the scariest thing I've heard today.
We're gonna own this festival!
Lurking in the shadows of the festival...
"Lambda Rabbit" welcomes you to the new festival. Ominous.
