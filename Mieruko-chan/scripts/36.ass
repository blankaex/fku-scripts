Mieruko-chan anime coming this Fall!
I've exorcised the specter.
Spirits, begone!
Oka Towako
Exorcism Exhibition {bottom right sign}
Yet another success!
That was Oka Towako on Exorcism Exhibition.
Thank you so much.
She's helped another family find solace on this fine evening.
I can't believe they're still airing this.
What a joke.
Spirits, begone!
Hahaha
I'm also an actor, after all.
The famous spiritualist Towako, exorcising on your television.
Mieruko-chan

It's not like they could have just found a cursed family to help.
You could've said no.
The producer is pretty well-connected, you know?
Always after the money, huh?
Money is important, Mitsue.
It helps me help those who are actually in need.
...
Does it now?
Anyway, how's he been? Have you been getting along?
...
Look, I've kept quiet until now, but...

{3}
That kid...
He's extremely powerful.
pop
pop
Probably even more powerful than us.
Yes, he's very talented.
How long do I need to keep him?
I don't know what the deal is,
but I'm not running a day care here.
That boy recognizes that he's different,
but he's still just a child.
pop
pop
I can't leave him with just anyone.
It'd be too dangerous.
So it needs to be someone like us.

{4}
Someone needs to guide him down the right path.

Before he strays too far from it.

And you're a much better fit for the job than I am, right?
I'm always at the studio.
Gimme a break.
I'm not doing it!

{5}
Hey, don't make a mess.
Eat your vegetables.
Hey.
Home time.

Spirits, begone!

Shindou Romm.
That'll be your name.
It's tradition to give your apprentice a second name.
You can think of it like a stage name, I guess.
There's no deep meaning behind it or anything.
You don't need to use it if you don't want to.

{7}
Thank you.
I'll be Shindou Romm.
...
All right.
...
Then starting today, you're Godmother's first apprentice.
All right?

{8}
Romm!

{9}
I can't see it!
Is Miko okay? What should I do?
One wrong move and she's done for!
Where the hell did you go, Romm?!

{10}
Huh?
It's so dark.
Wait... Am I de—
{mask し}

{11}
No, I'm not.
It was pitch black the last time I went through one as well.
So that means...
I'm in its mouth!
What do I do?
If it's anything like last time, I can just walk out.
But should I?
No matter what they say to you,
no matter what they do to you,
you mustn't say a word or react in any way.
He was very insistent.
I should probably sit tight.

Oh...

I can't wait any longer!
It was too much for her after all!
Mi—
Oh...

{25}
I'm so tired from climbing those stairs.
My legs are so sore.{meme font}
I need to rest for a bit.{meme font}

{26}
Oh my god...
My knees gave out...
But I have to stay strong...
This is all I can do...

{27}
So I want to do my best.
If there's something I can do, then I'll do it!
You've done enough.
If I let that girl suffer any longer,
then I'm not the Godmother of Downtown!
Ain't that right?

{28}
Remember me?
I'm older now, but I'm back!
I'm sending Miko home.
No matter what.

Mrs. Mitsue!
