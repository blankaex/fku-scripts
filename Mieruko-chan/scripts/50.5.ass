It's kind of burning up... Because of Hana's aura?
I was starving that day!
maybe because of all the exercise?
That's a damn mighty aura.
(Miko is) so cute!
Haha, thanks!
I've never looked back like this,
but it looks like I can see them even in old photos.
There's quite a lot of them...

Haha Miko your face looks dumb!
Speak for yourself.
aaaah smol miko is so cute too
yurikawa is kind of in the way
I wonder if she'll let me keep a few? surely she will?
she took photos of me, after all.
I want photos of her too!

Some train lines will also be temporarily suspended—
What? They're stopping the trains?
I mean, it's Sunday tomorrow.
Why don't you guys just stay over?

{12}
Yeah it'd be pretty dangerous to send you all back in this weather.
I don't mind if your parents are fine with it.
Yay, sleepover!
Woohoo!
Yeah... At a friend's house...
Yeah, at Miko's!
Hey, You?
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah.
It's raining really badly outside so I'll be staying at a friend's house tonight.

Okay.

Could I borrow the phone, Michiru?
I should say hi—
It's fine.
Are you sure? I really should—
My sister is busy at the moment
and she hung up straight away.
I'll let her know you said hi.

Oh, I-I don't have a change of clothes.
