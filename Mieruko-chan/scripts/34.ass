Mieruko-chan
A congregation spiritually robed. What is their goal?{goal? destination?}

{2}

{4}
Whoa, did you see that?
I think it was a fox.
Foxes are my favorite animal!
Though I don't really like animals, to be honest.
I would just pick foxes if I had to choose.
What's your favorite animal, Miko?
I dunno... Anacondas?
Anaconda Anaguma
Whoa, anacondas are awesome!
Hahaha
And what exactly do you like about anacon—
Will you shut up already?

{5}
We're not on a picnic.
You of all people should know that, Romm.
Of course I do.
So, what's your favorite animal, Mrs. Mitsue?
{merge}
...
I heard they've known each other for quite a while.
They don't seem to get along very well, though.
Awkward...
I don't know what he told you, Miko, but don't trust him.
{merge}
He only cares about himself.
That's not a very nice thing to say. I'm right here...

{6}
Maybe you're the one she shouldn't trust.
!
What did you just say?
All I did was answer her questions.
There he goes again with his nitpicking...
It's actually very important.
How else do you expect to earn someone's trust?
"Don't worry. Leave it to me."
Sounds great on paper, but it doesn't mean anything in practice.
You didn't tell her anything.
How trustworthy you must be.
What do you know?

{7}
Some things are better left unsaid.
I told you to leave Miko out of this.
You're making a fundamental mistake here.
Miko is the party in question.
Don't you think it's up to her?
She should decide whether or not she wants to know.

{8}
Sparrows.
Huh?
My favorite animal.
I like sparrows.
...
I think she feels like talking now.

{ghost speak}
This mountain is a well-known gathering spot.{like a ghost hotspot. we used "gathering spot" in 14}
There are plenty of them lingering, as I'm sure you're aware.
All of the residents moved out, so there are abandoned buildings everywhere.{Wow is this Mayoiga}
No one even dares to come close anymore.

{10}
Other than a select few, of course.
Huh?
"If you pray to the god of this mountain,
he will grant whatever you wish for."
I'm sure most shrines have similar superstitions,
but it's a pretty enticing deal for those in the know.
...
So...
It's because I prayed at the shrine?

{11}
The god may grant wishes,
but surely you don't expect them to do it for free.
Like when you sign up for a site that has free registration and perks for joining,
they'll usually charge a fee for cancelling your membership.
Take a look at my site. I've written this very clearly in the fine print.
You shut up, Romm.
What does that mean?
They want something in return?
...
That's right.
Wh-What...
What do I need to give?

{12}
Only the person who made the wish would know.
Though, it's true that many powerful mediums have gone missing.
...
I just wanted to take Hana somewhere sacred to get rid of the thing that was following her around...
squeeze
And your wish was granted straight away?
Huh?
Y-Yeah...
Then they probably would have wanted to be paid on the spot.
I'm not sure why they would have let you go.
Please help, I'll do anything to have that thing stop following her.
Please lift this curse from Hana. Also help me out, while you're at it.

{13}
Could it be because...
I asked them to help me, too?
!
They said "three times".
Three times.
After that, the ones in the kimonos showed up whenever I needed help.
I was wondering if that meant they would only rescue me three times.
Maybe I was wrong, though.

{14}
That's quite unconventional.
Most people who visit will come intentionally, with one clear wish.
To cure a terminal disease, for example.
But you just waltzed in by accident,
and made two wishes.
And a very vague wish, at that.
They must have had a tough time handling your request.

{15}
If we assume "three times" refers to the number of times they'll help you,
then your three chances are already up.{How could Romm know this?}
What do you suppose might happen if you default on your debts?
That's right. Your cosigner will be responsible.
!
Romm!
Yes, Ma'am?{Hai, Kazuma desu}
That's enough!

{16}
Why do you insist on tormenting her?
I'm simply stating the possibilities.
Romm...
I won't let you have your way!
It's not too late, Miko.
You can still turn back.
If you go to the shrine again,
you might not be able to leave.
I didn't come without a plan.
Go home, Miko.
While you still can.
I can't...

{17}
Great idea!
Let's let Mrs. Mitsue take care of everything.
Huh?
She was planning to clean up this mess on her own anyway, right?
I'm touched.
She knows that countless powerful mediums have gone missing, yet she's totally unfazed!
If Mrs. Mitsue isn't able to solve the problem, no one will be able to help you and Hana.
When the time comes, you'll just have to pay back whatever you owe.

{18}
Does your selfishness know no bounds?
Selfish?
Wouldn't that be you?
You're just going to let the past repeat itself.

{19}
Romm!

{20-21}

Oh dear.
This doesn't look good.

What do we do, Mrs. Mitsue?

Do you have a plan?
heeey
...
hey
hey

{23}
On my mark,
follow me.

{24}

{25}
Now!
What the heck was that? That was awesome!
Your tactics are almost as old as you.
O-Oh, really?
We don't have time to fight all of them.
They're following us!
I suppose now would be a good time.

{26}
Huh?
Lambda Rabbit?

{27}
Romm! Where did you get that?
I got it back from Hana.
This is our ticket to the shrine.

{28}
This Lambda Rabbit is brimming with power!
I wish Hana were here in person, though.
squeak
It would've been a lot easier.
That's Hana's Lambda Rabbit?
What did you do to her?
Nothing in particular.
I just borrowed a bit of her aura.

{29}
Were you planning this from the start?
Not at all.
This was Plan B.
I don't know if it will work,
but I don't think we have time to stand around and chat.
heeey
heeey
heeey
Give it a rest...

Don't you have anything a bit more modern?

{31}
What—
What the hell is this noise?
It's heavy metal.

{32}
rustle

It's working?
I hear it can cure sickness, too.
No way!
Whoa!

{33}

It's those bells!
Looks like it worked.

Success?
They fended off the evil spirits, and the entrance appeared before them.
