Nurse Station
The boiler room woman?
Oh, you haven't heard?
You can hear a woman groaning from the boiler room at night.
Wow, really?
Creepy!
That's enough to scare you?
You might want to consider a career change.
Yeah, we always get nurse call alerts from empty rooms.
And you can hear footsteps down the hallway at night.
Wheelchair noises as well.
Mieruko-chan
They're all just rumors, though.

Foosteps and wheelchairs?
What's wrong with that?
We're in a hospital, isn't that normal?
Oh, you think?
I guess if you put it that way...
C'mon, chief!
Yeah, now that you mention it.
Footsteps and wheelchairs shouldn't be a surprise.
I don't even remember what I was scared of.
Okay, that's enough! Back to work!

I don't think it's chasing me.

I've gotten pretty far from my room.
I just wanted to go to the toilet...

Yep, I guess I'll head back this way—

{11}
Oh no...
I've been pincered!
N-Not good...
gnash
What do I do?

{12}
That's right, I don't need to run...
If I just stand still then they'll pass right through me...
...
Will they?{MITCHER YOU RUINED HER}

{13}
Oh my god, it's coming!
I'll be fine!
It'll pass through me! Just stand still! Or should I turn around and run? Is this going to work? Will it pass through me? Which way should I go? W-What do I do?

{14-15}
OOH I'M GONNA BUST{tfw izumi made the pissposting canon}
Not the wheelchair! I'd rather go this way!

Good evening.

Wh-What are you doing here?
Where'd you get that?
Oh this?
It was $30 at Target.
That's not what I meant...
Miss Yotsuya,
the patients' rooms are this way.
Huh?
Can't blame you for being confused, you did hit your head pretty hard.
Huh? What?
But that way's—
It looks like you twisted your ankle.
Could you crouch down so I can have a look?
What? Why?
Crouch down.

{21}
What?

{22-23}


{24}
Oh, this looks pretty bad.
We'd better get you treated straight away.
