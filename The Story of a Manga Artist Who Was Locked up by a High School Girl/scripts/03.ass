knock knock
!
Is that the Terminator?

02
You still haven't drawn anything?
I haven't been feeling it lately... I've just been trashing every sketch I start.
I don't even know what to draw anymore.
All right.
Why don't you try and draw me, then?

03
I've drawn schoolgirls in the past, but now that I think about it,
I've never really had the chance to study one up-close.
When the thought crossed my mind, I instinctively took a really good look at her for the first time since my confinement began.
The shape of her face through her mask.
The colour of her hair.
The length of her eyelashes.
The mole on her neck.

04
The positions of her piercings.
The designs on her nails.
How crazy must I look? Drawing the very person who's keeping me locked up.
But the creative juices were flowing.
There was no way I could suppress this urge to draw.
