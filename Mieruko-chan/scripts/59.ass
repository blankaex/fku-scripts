lambda rabbit mmff donut mofmsdf
What?
Donut?
moifmdosif!!
Hey, Hana!
wahaha
wait!

{3}
I didn't think so many people would be into Lambda Rabbit.
{mask}
It's been trending on TokTik lately, plus doing crossovers and stuff.
Or so Hana says.
How are you doing, by the way?
I heard Hana took you out for food.
I mostly just watched her eat.{LOOOOOL}
...
I wish I could eat as much as Hana...
Then I would have more power.
You might need some special training for that...
Miko!
Look!

{4}
They have impaled rabbit heads!
How horrific!
No better way to say that?
They're candied apples...
Ah... Better not look at that one.
...
Let's check out this side!
But the stakes...

{5}
Maybe I'll get one.
I think Hana would like it.
Excuse me—
Huh?
Ain't that Niguredou?
I knew it was you!
Long time no see! Remember me?

{6}
What do you mean you can see ghosts and stuff?{ch12p3}
What an attention seeker.{ch12p3}
Gross!{ch12p3}
Mikumo Aya...
Gross!
I'm part-timing at the moment.
...
How long's it been, since like grade school? You haven't changed at all!
...
Uhh...
...
Huh?
You do remember me, right?
...
I...
Do...
...

{7}
Phew, had me worried!
I thought you'd forgotten about me!
Your leg...
Oh, this?
I fell down the stairs.
It's nothing serious.
But I feel like I've been injuring this leg a lot lately.
Crazy, right?
...
Say, Niguredou...

{8}
Couldn't you like...
See ghosts or something?
...
slip
Why do you ask?
Oh, y'know...
Just came to mind...
So, d'ya still—
Course not.
Huh?

{9}
Of course I can't see ghosts.
I was lying.
I just wanted to stand out.
Hey, uhh...
Sorry.
My friends are waiting.
Oh...
...

{10}
Everything okay?
Did you know her?
Not really...
L-Let's go find Hana!
She might overeat again!
Miko?
Oh, sorry! Coming!

{11}
New Years Lambda Rabbit Festival
Test, one, two... You all having fun?
Uh, I mean, having a rabi-rabi time?{what sound does a rabbit make man fuck I hate this}
Wooo!
Thanks for coming to the festival today! ...rabi
Yeah!
Whoa, it's Lambda Tanaka!
Lambda is his last name?{rabbit lore}
Apparently there are several rabbits.
But they all look the same.

{12}
So uh yeah, you know
We're doing a festival... and stuff...
Uhh... thanks to the park... umm... staff? for letting us use this venue...
We're uh... deeply grateful...
Why is he talking like a school principal?
What's wrong with this rabbit?
~~
~~
...
Anyway, take a look behind you!
See that huge tree?{man what the fuck is https://jisho.org/search/シンボルツリー}

We're gonna turn it into a special lambda light-up!
Lambda change!
It's so pretty!
Wow!

Don't forget hashtag #lambdarabbitfestival
rabi
We'll be selling a limited run of light-up lambda rabbits after this!

{14}
Hey
Where's Julia?{who's talking lol}
Are you okay?
Where'd you go?
Missed Call

{15}
I might be able to become an exorcist or something.{ch12p3}
I'll become the object of everyone's envy. My life is set!{ch12p3}
I want to get stronger.{ch32p25}
I want to become a real medium, like you and Godmother.{ch32p25}
Gross!
Of course I can't see ghosts.
I was lying.
I just wanted to stand out.

{16}
I'm not cut out to be medium...
Niguredou?

{17}
Wha—
Why are you here?
Huh?
I just finished work early...
What are you up to, anyway?
Huh?
You crying?
...
N-No...
Anyway, I'm busy.
Bye!
Hey!
Why are you chasing me?
Because you're running away!
I'm not...

{18}
And this is a dead end, anyway...
!
...
See?
...
Niguredou...
Do you...{hate me? I guess?}

{19}
Whoa!
Ah!
Is it fun to scare people like that?{ch32p12}
You think you're some kind of girl that sees them?{ch32p12}
You're such a freak.{ch32p12}

{20}
!
...
Th—
Thanks...
Ow...
Not my leg again...
Think I grazed it...
...
It's cursed.
Huh?

{21}
Your leg.
I see something.
Looks cursed.
Like, a ghost?
Huh? Uhh...
Like a hand?
It's kind of hazy...
Looks like it's kind of grabbing you.

{22}
Gross...{btfod}
So it is a ghost!
Gross!
!
I knew I shouldn't have gone to that haunted spot!
I keep hurting this leg!
Ugh, this sucks, oh my god!
You believe me?
Huh?
You can see it, right?
I mean, yeah...
...

{23}
I don't have any... spiritual powers?
And none of my friends believe in that stuff.
But I kept getting injured
and I remembered you.
Back when we were in grade school,
you made a fuss about a ghost in the back of the class and made a bunch of kids cry.
Stop it!
It's true!
Some people got mad because you were so pushy about it
I called you a freak
and said some other awful things.
But having nobody believe you
is pretty rough, huh?

{24}
Although,
you were kinda freaky.
What?
I mean, does it really matter if it's true or not?
At the end of the day, you were still upsetting people.
...
Hana gets scared easily...{god is this another flashback}{Could not for the life of me find it}
I guess... you're right...
...
Here!

{25}
As thanks for telling me!
You wanted one, right?
Oh...
Thanks...
No problem, they gave me a bunch.
Do you mind if I try something?
Not sure if it'll work...
Try what?

{26}
An exorcism...
Hello? Hana? Did you find Julia?
No sign of her yet...
And she's not picking up...

{27}
Where's Michiru?
She said she'd wait by the tree in case Julia comes back.
She'll stick out like a sore thumb...
It's better if she does...
True... All right, I'll keep looking a little—
Oh!
What happened? Did you find her?
Not yet... But let me just check to be sure...
I'll call you back.
...
~~
Is that Julia's voice?

{28}
Spider!{tfw brainlet mushroom}
Is it gone?
Uh... No...
Not yet...
This is pretty cool, is that how exorcisms work these days?
Some kind of spell?
Not quite...

{29}
I knew I wasn't good enough...
...
ruffle
ruffle
I still have Romm's power stone...
Power stones are like demon repellent,{another offscreen flashback?}{Think so}
so they can drive off your low-level riff-raff.
If the stone stars to shake,
then you'll know it's working.

{30}
However...
If it starts to crack and fissure,
then you should take it as a warning sign.
Miko?
What you're dealing with can't be handled by an amateur,

{31}
and you should run away as fast as you can.
Julia!

Whoa!
That was a strong gust!

{36}
...
?
H-Huh?
It's gone?

{37}
Wait, really?
...
My leg definitely feels a lot better!
You're amazing, Niguredou!

Huh?
But I didn't do anything...
Thank you!
!
...
Y—
Yeah...

{38}
Julia!
We were so worried!
I thought you'd been kidnapped!
S-Sorry...
Can't breathe...{classic}
I'm glad we found her.{wtf lol}
Uh,
yeah...
But what was that thing?
{mask}
See you later, Niguredou!
I'm gonna head off!
Oh.

{39}
...
Bye!
Who's that?
A friend?
...
Acquaintance...

{40}
Sorry, Hana.
You missed out on buying the light-up rabbit because of me.
Don't sweat it!
No big deal!
I'm just happy that you're here.
Sorry for troubling you too, Miko.
That was your doing earlier, right?
Huh?
You know... The exorcism...
Uh, no...
I got ahead of myself...
I thought I could take care of it.
But I lacked the resolve and the power.
I just end up hurting myself and those around me.
I'm still not good enough.

{41}
...
Don't get up to any more dangerous antics on your own, okay?
Not that I exorcised anything...
But if it keeps her out of trouble,
then let's go with that...
Okay...
Hey!
Just a sec!
?
Lambda rabbit power!
Thank you, gods of the park!{oh no it was her all along}
You helped bring Julia back to us!

{42}
Hana?
Sorry for the wait!
What should we eat next?
You still wanna eat?
The festival's not over yet!
gulp
