You don't ferment puddings.

Weather sure is nice today.
I feel like I see more and more of them every day.
Hmm, I wonder how long that one's been there for.
I don't think it was there three days ago.

No, stop!
Think fun things!
I have the chestnut pudding I bought from Dawson yesterday.

Eat up quickly
Or you'll be late.

Hey sis, you don't look so good.
Not enough sleep?
Did you have a bad dream?
Maybe you got dumped by your boyfriend?
Just kidding...
Haha
Boyfriend.
This happened because you leave your belly out when you sleep.
Even though I fixed your blanket for you.
Haha...
You don't actually have a boyfriend do you?
Belly.

Something wrong Miko?
Sniff
No, nothing.

Oh yeah I saw a pudding in the fridge,

Did you forget something?
What's wrong?

Is that for me...
Miko?
Sorry for eating your pudding back then...
I always wanted to apologize...
But in the end{IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER}
I never got a chance to...

Bye.
I'm not sure how I feel about seeing my dad's ghost.
Pudding
No!
It's mine!
Miko gave it to me.
