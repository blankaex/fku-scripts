C'mon, you gotta tell me!
tap

Come on!
At least tell me if there's a dark horse!{he's asking her to predict horse races}
Oof!{memes}
What the fuck are you doing, bitch?
Is this how you treat all your customers?
Customer, eh?
The mysterious fortune teller delivers the rude customer a scathing blow.{lit. "who is this fortune teller that.." but too loaded imo}

{2}
Take your money back, then.
Now you're not a customer.
Why do they call you the Godmother of Downtown?
You're just a crazy hag!
Who are you calling a hag?
Care to give death a try?
Eek!

{3}
You should give the gambling a rest.
Your wife's worried about you.
You just outed yourself, you fraud!
My wife—
—died in an accident three years ago, right?
Wh-What?
She didn't mean what she said on the night you last spoke.{Don't wanna keep it first person and maintain the quotes?}
!
She really wanted to say the opposite.
I-Is she here with us?
Yeah.
What did she tell you on that night?
...

{4}
"I wish I never married you."
...{I wanna mask this but if you're ceebs I guess}
Your wedding ring is the only thing you haven't pawned, right?
Get out of this hag's shop.
Get back on your feet.
And show your wife what kind of man you really are.
BBQ

{5}
Geez.
Business ain't doing great.
Godmother{TS: think this part should be more main-title-y}
Good Fortune & Divination{TS: and this should be more of a subtitle}
Hi Mitsue.
Helping people out again?
{—}ination
Nah.
Just chasing off an annoying customer.
That's very kind of you.
So, what can I do you for?
I had a favor to ask of a certain empathetic young lady.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Here now.

{6}
Could you look after this boy?

{7}
Would you look at that.
Whoa!

{8}


{9}
Never thought we'd set foot here again.
Sure brings back memories, doesn't it?
!
You've been here before?!
...
It's all in the past.
Why didn't you tell us about that doll, Romm?
You're welcome!
I'm glad to be of service.
I wish Hana were here in person, though.{34, 228}
squeak
It would've been a lot easier.
It would probably work out a lot better if she were here.{33, 176}

{10}
So that's what it was.
We needed Hana's aura to get to the shrine.
...
That's right.
There's a barrier.
That's why we can't simply waltz in.
If the barrier isn't torn down,
Navigation complete.{26, 178}
Huh?
we can't enter.
I had my suspicions when I saw your photo, but I was convinced after seeing Hana in person.

{11}
Hana's aura can tear down this barrier.
We're almost there.
Look!
There's a torii!{we used torii in 11}{Damn we're weebs}
That's why I planted some stones to borrow some of her aura.
Oh, don't worry.
They won't have affected her at all.
Romm, you knew Miko would never bring Hana.
This wasn't your Plan B.
What were you going to do if it didn't work?
Well... I'm glad that it did.

{12}
Very glad indeed...{Check in QC}
That we didn't have to use Plan C.
...
So what are we going to do now?
Since it's a god, should we make an offering?
Remember what happened last time you tried that?
With the tofu.
It's only a god in folklore.
No one knows what that horrifying creature actually is.
They just call it a god.

{13}
It's do-or-die now, Miko.
clunk
Are you ready?
!

{14}


{15}


{16}


{17}
...
I-It's so pissed!
Am I really gonna be okay?
What are these for?
Sunglasses and lucky charms? And salt?
It's my fabulous merchandise, brimming with power.{surprised he didn't charge her tbh}
They'll increase your spiritual defenses.

{18}
Defenses?
Okay, Miko.
Listen closely.
Here's your mission.
You need to enter the shrine by yourself.
Huh?
I knew it! You were trying to get her—
Shall I go, then?
Or would you like to go?
!
Wh-What do I need to do?
Why do I need to go alone?
You don't need to do a thing.
Huh?

{19}
There's nothing you can do.
So don't do a thing.
You're the only one who can do this.
No matter what they say to you,
no matter what they do to you,
you mustn't say a word or react in any way.
You have a very clear purpose.

{20-21}
You'll be a decoy.

{22}
Eeeek! It's there!

{23}
Aaaahhh...
It's kinda saying something...
oh god oh god oh god oh god
They have business with you.
They weren't able to request payment previously for a simple reason.
You were outside the barrier.

{24}
This so called "God of the Mountain"
probably can't maintain its power outside the barrier.
If you enter the shrine, it will surely demand payment.
I need you to buy us time.
!
While you're keeping it busy,
I'll bring down the barrier and take away its powers.

{25}
You think it'll be that easy?
I don't.
That's why we should work together.
All three of us!
This is too much for Miko.
We'll come up with someth—
It's fine.
I'll do it.
!

{26}
I think I'm pretty good
at ignoring them.{:^)}{no}
Don't be stupid! This isn't like all the other times!
Do you remember what you told me at the diner?
You're amazing.{27, 199}
So young, yet so brave.
I'm impressed.
That made me really happy.
So I want to do my best.
If there's something I can do, then I'll do it!{;;}
Please do what you can too!

{27}
!
Cheeky girl.
Miko.
You really are amazing.
Thank you!

{28}
oh my god it's so close please no
These are the Sunglasses of Light.

{29}
Aaaaahh!
The Sunglasses of Light!
clack
...
And this salt is absolutely brimming with power.

The salt!

These charms are also brimming with power!
The charms!

{30}
Umm... How long will these hold?
Hmm...
Imagine when there's a strand of hair in your food.
It's kind of annoying to pick out, right?
About that long.

{31}
!
It's better than nothing...
Hang in there...
Please hurry...
Romm... Mrs. Mitsue...

{32}


{33}
Quickly, quickly...
It'll be faster if we split up.
You take that side.

{34-35}


{36}
No!
Miko!
Not good...
The power items fought valiantly though in vain—a scene of carnage all that remains.
