...then the main character
climbs up the ladder and meets the heroine.
The story between here and the part in the old town
shows up often in tests.
The music box and ribbon are important motifs.
You should be good if you can get that down!

Oh, sorry for not catching your drift.
Here!
Huh?
I wasn't really after that...

I was just impressed at how smart you sounded.
Hehe, surprised?
Different to usual, right?
Huh? Yeah...

{3}
I've never seen you wear glasses before either.
Oh, these?
I put them on when I study so my blood sugar doesn't escape.
Kind of like a lid.
They're fake.{no prescription}
Uh... What?
??
???
Are you good too, Michiru?
...
Yes.

{4}
I'm taking it all in.
That's great!{is this orange hair girl or mierka}{Looks like orange hair girl bubble, but main girl font}
I feel like I'm being watched...
Is Michiru really learning anything?
I can't see Miko's face...

{5}
Man, studying in here sure takes me back.
Remember, Miko?
The two of us used to do this all the time.
Did you two go to the same middle school?
I didn't know that.
Yep!
In fact, we've been together since elementary!
We became friends around fourth grade, I think?
Yeah.
I gave her some bread at lunch and she started following me around.
Bread!{Would normally mask this too}
Is she a wild animal?
That's so Hana.

{6}
Oh Miko, do you remember that one time?
We were studying for a test here!
You started leaning on me like this all of a sudden,
but you'd just fallen asleep.
I couldn't wake you up, so I just let you be,
but then I fell asleep on top of you as well.
And then when we woke up,
we were both in your bed somehow.{humble brag}

{7}
That was so funny!
snap
That does sound fun.

She's really glaring!
I feel like she tries to intimidate Hana a lot,
but I don't know why...{dumb migo}{Mienai-ko}
All right, let's take a break from the books.

{9}
It's snack time!
You've been snacking this whole time, Hana.
Snacking while studying is to help me concentrate,
and snacking during snack time is for snacking!
Oh right, of course. Silly me.
Have some, Michiru.
It'll help you study.
You'll get better grades next time for sure!
Hana, you're the only person who can convert sugar to test scores.

Would you tell me about her?
Everything.

{16}
Wait... No... Really!?

Sorry, Miko.
I couldn't help myself.
Huh?
Oh.
I-It's fine...
I don't really know what's going on,
but I guess I'm inside the tentacles...

Nice to meet you.
I'm Miko's brother.
I'm getting along very very well with Miko.
Very well.

I'm sorry...
Huh?
Sorry...
sniff
I'm really sorry...

I noticed you were both on your phones and not looking ahead,
but I didn't step out of the way...

{25}
I'm so sorry... Please forgive me!
I'm sorry!

Is she being bullied?
They were walking with their phones out?{I feel like someone bumped into izumi recently}
What terrible people.
Let's get out of here...
Gross...
Are you okay?
Why wouldn't I be?
Huh?
Uhh...

You told me you were going to the hair salon...

Wherefore art thou, sister?
Why? How come? Lies make me sad...
