{punished mitcher}
Look!
I found Pii!
He was in the vase on the table today!

{17}
Looks like he managed to get a lot further this time.{can we assume catterpillar gender}
...
Pii...
Your hair's a mess...
What am I gonna do with you?
You don't need to turn your room upside-down
every time Pii escapes.

{18}
I've found him for you every time,
haven't I?{susge}
Look, the car's already here to pick you up.
Have a good day!

Michiru...

{21}
Y'know what?
There's gonna be a Lambda Rabbit meet'n'greet!
Oh yeah?
There gonna be someone in a Lambda Rabbit costume?
It's not a costume!
Lambda Rabbit is Lambda Rabbit!
Haha, sorry.
Silly me.
Hahaha, you're so light Miko!{fatty out}
Put me down already, Hana...
Your turn, Miko!
Hahaha!
I wonder what sandwiches they have today!
Don't run, you'll fall.

{22}
â™ª
Hana...
Centipede.{I remember this one}
Eek!
Where?! Where's the centipede?!
Sorry, just my imagination.
?
You seriously gotta stop that!
Let go of me already, Hana...
But you scared me!

{23}
Want some, Miko?
What's this?
I dunno, but it's delicious!
Want some, Michiru?
No.
Ever since the sleepover,
I feel like Michiru's tentacles have calmed down.
I hope it's not a bad sign.
Romm...
I hope you're actually looking into this for me.

{24}
See you!
Bye!
Hey, Miko!
Let's stop by Moonbucks on the way home!
There's a new triple something that I wanna try!
Sure.
Lemme see if Michiru and Julia wanna come too!
Hey...

{25}
Is that Michiru's sister?
Why did she come to school?
Does she want to complain about the sleepover?
...
No, that has nothing to do with the school... Is she just here to pick up Michiru?
Hey, Hana...

{26}
Hm?
Huh?
...
Hana?

{28}
Sorry to bring you out all this way, Yurikawa.

I hope it's not too much trouble.
mm
You look like you're having trouble breathing.
Are you okay?

{29}
ngh!
Phew! Sorry!
I'm fine.
I was just surprised. You fed me a bun out of nowhere!
It was delicious, though! {mask the side text}
What's the matter all of a sudden, Michiru?
I don't think Miko noticed we left.
I need your advice,
Yurikawa.{maybe fluff something to avoid the split}

{30}
Huh? For real?!
Me?!
Hehehe
Thanks for asking!
Anything for you!
What do you need?

{31}
I've been wanting to chat with you more!
I was hoping we could become better friends.
We had the sleepover at Miko's the other day,
but you had to leave early.
Oh but if you need help,
maybe we should ask Miko and Julia as well?
No.

{32}
Just the two of us.
Huh?
Huh?
Hana
Did you leave already, Hana?
No answer
Hana?
Where'd you go, Hana?
Unread...
No reception.
Scary peanut gallery.
