What did you need from me, Sir?
squeeze
...
I don't recall asking Yotsuya to come...

{2}
You're totally right.
I'll just wait outside.
It's okay.
But Mr. Zen said--
I don't mind.
O-Oh okay...
It's nothing serious.
There was just something I wanted to ask about.
I had a look at your previous test, Ichijou.
You answered every question, but got a zero.
I was wondering why that was.

{3}
She answered everything and got a zero?!
I'd understand getting a zero if you just handed in a blank answer sheet,
but you've attempted every question on the test.
A lot of them were multiple choice questions too, so I'm surprised you didn't get any correct
Care to explain this?
I tried my best.

{4}
You did, did you?
I did.
...
Awkward...
Sir,
this one is correct.
It's not.{LOL}
Why am I even here?
I'm sure I don't need to ask,
but you didn't do this on purpose, did you?
I tried my best.
...
Did you now?
I see.
I did.
squeeze
Why won't she let go of my hand?

{5}
I'm not very smart.
O-Oh...
Most of your test results for other subjects were around zero too,
so I was wondering if this might be some kind of rebellious stunt.
Around zero?
But if that's not the case then I won't pry.
It's not.
That's it?
May we leave?
Hold on.
One last thing.
I received a call from your sister earlier.

{6}
!
snap
slip
Sorry, Miko.
Would you mind waiting in the hallway after all?
Huh?
S-Sure...

{7}
She finally let me go...
It changed shape as soon as Mr. Zen mentioned her sister.
I wonder what that was...
about...
O-Oh... She didn't let me go at all...

{8}
How far does this stretch, anyway?
So, what did my sister say?
Right, yes.
I can hear them from here.
She wants me to put you in a different class,
because your current class is a bad influence.

{9}
Huh?
Bad influence? Does she mean us?
...
slurp
Sure, we went to MD's that one time...
But just for that?
mmf
...
I see.
...
Why?
tap tap{We'd normally skip these, since no bubble. Your call, Varric}
tap tap tap tap
Oh, it's a tiny old—

Are you having a hard time in class?
Not particularly...

{11}
I see.
That's good to hear.
fwoosh
tap tap tap tap
?
How about your friends?
Excuse me.
Um...
Are you going to put me in a different class?

{12}
Do you want to join a different class?
...
No.
All right.
Let's leave it at that, then.

{13}
You're not going to put me in a different class?
You don't want to, right?
...
But my sister might call again.
After having spoken to both you and your sister,
I've decided that there is no need to put you in a different class.
That's all.

{14}
You should think about what you really want.
It's okay to be a little selfish sometimes.
...
Things can get rough otherwise.
Wow, Mr. Zen...
Oh!
The spikes are retracting...

{15}
That cat.
It's pretty cute.
Mocha.
Do you like cats?
No.
...
You're rather strange.
...

{16}
I kind of ended up eavesdropping on their conversation,
but it sounds like Michiru has a lot going on too...
I wonder what's up with her sister?
What kind of relationship do they have?
Are these tentacles a part of Michiru?
I feel like they're protecting her... Sort of.
Are they not so bad after all?
slip

{17}
I wonder if Romm can tell me anything
if I show him this photo?
Hana
stare
We already ate everything!
Is Michiru with you?
Oh, it's Hana...
Sorry... I'll be...
Right there...
tap tap
...and send.
Oh, it's the tiny old guy from be—

{18-19}

{20}
{Mask}
It's a huge old guy!{Btw, there was a "big old guy" in 08, but this guy's bigger, so keeping huge.}
Huh?
she did it
she did it
Wait!
snap
No way!
They think that was me?

{21}
Eek!

{22}
Noo!
Argh!
slurp

{23}
Grr

It wasn't me!

{24}
Grr!
I wonder what's on TicToc...

Eek!
He's trying to tear it apart!
Grr
haha lol

{25}
Wait how does this even work?
I don't feel anything right now, but is my arm going to be okay?
Gettem!
Revenge!
Revenge!
Gettem!
plop

{26}
Sorry to keep you waiting, Miko.

{27}
Ah...
Ah?

{28-29}
{btfod}

{30}
Aagh!
Noo!
Aahh!
Is something the matter?
What's wrong, Miko?

{31}
Aaahh!
Nooo!
I'm saved...
But...
squeeze
Nope!
I'm totally fine.
hehe
The tentacles aren't that bad...
After all?
That's good.
Oh, Miko.
Miko... Miko... Miko...

{32}
I was just thinking,
getting a zero is actually not so great.
I think you should study a little more,
but I don't have time to give you extra lessons.

{33}
Yotsuya,
would you mind helping Ichijou with her studies?
Huh?
Wh-Why me?
My grades aren't that good...
Huh?
I mean...
Aren't you friends?

{34}
I'd love to study with you, Miko.
Let's go to your house.
Thanks, Yotsuya.
See you later.
clack
Mr. Zen is such a nice person.
...
Yeah...
Study group at Miko's house?
Zen the wingman.
