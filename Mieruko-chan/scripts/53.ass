My condolences, Ichijou.
I heard it was a head-on collision.
Michiru is still so small.
Poor thing.
I have to
proect Michiru.
Mieruko-chan
You's unwavering determination began to sprout that day.

{2}
As per our previous conversation,
we can't change class enrollments barring exceptional circumstances.
If there's a strong reason for your request, you should have a discussion—
All right.
I'm unenrolling her from this school.

{3}
{susge}
Excuse me?{r u srs}
I'll be back another day to do the paperwork.
Let's go home, Michiru.
This isn't where you belong.
Huh?
Her location is off.
Yeah.
Thanks, Julia.
I'll look a little longer.

{4}
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please—
H-Hello...
Yotsuya!
Why are you still at school?
If you're done with class then you should head home.
Oh, umm...
Hana disappeared all of a sudden.
Have you seen her, Sir?
No...
I can't get in touch with her either.
I'm a little worried.

{5}
Hana?
Is this her?
Huh?
I recognize this photo...
Why do you—

{6}
Ichijou Michiru. Yurikawa Hana.
Please come to the staff room as soon as possible.

{7}
Huh? Did we just get PA'd?
I didn't hear a thing.
Hey, we have no reception in here.
I hope Miko's not worrying about me.
Why should Miko
need to spend her time worrying about you?
heheh
Miko's a bit of a worrywart.
Yurikawa.

{8}
Tell me.
What's your relationship with Miko?
Huh?
Huh?

{9}
I want to become better friends with Miko.
Much, much, much better friends.
I want to be her friend, you see.
{pls check flashback}
Miko feels the same way.
To that end...

{10-11}
I'd like you to stay out of our way.

{12}
Kohane!
Here you go.
Remember?
You said your hat was blown away.
I found it in the sewers.{edit}
Here.

{13}
What?
That's gross.
I don't want it.
Michiru, it's dangerous down in the sewer.
Don't go down there again, okay?
Kohane was crying because she lost her hat.
So I was looking for it this whole time.

{14}
Right.
You're a good girl, Michiru.
Come on, You,
give me a break!
Michiru sneaked into Akari's bed again!
I'm sorry.{edit}
I hate you, Michiru!

{15}
Akari said she was scared to sleep alone.
That's why I went to visit her.
You're a good girl, Michiru.
You're so mean, Michiru!
Don't you feel sorry for Rena?
Yeah, what's wrong with you?
We're not playing with you anymore!
About Michiru's behaviour.
I think it's just Michiru's own way of communicating with her friends,{autism is a terrible disability}
but... How do I say this? It's a bit excessive at times.
Perhaps you could help with her discipline at home, too?

{16}
Why?
Why can't I play too?
Because I don't want you to be sad.
I'll stay with you, okay?

{17}
There was a bird.
It tried to eat him.
Can he be my friend?
Michiru...
Let's go home...

{18}
Student Radio Room.
Michiru is a bit of a strange child.
She doesn't do a great job of interacting with others.
It's hurt her a number of times in the past.
So I thought, if she had no friends in the first place,
there wouldn't be anyone to hurt her.{galaxy brain}

{19}
So I would separate her from others before they could become friends,
before she could get too close to anyone,
before they could leave her and hurt her.
{flashback check pls}
I'm a terrible sister, aren't I?
But that's how I've been protecting her this whole time.
Michiru only has one friend.
It's the catterpillar she's been keeping.
A catterpillar can't hurt her.
Until then.

{20}
Every time her catterpillar turned into a coccoon, I would swap them out.
I'll find him!
Pii!
Pii's gone!
But one time, I forgot. And that's when things started going downhill.
Once Michiru started middle school,
she'd unfortunately made some friends.
It led to the worst.

{21}
I think Hana
is with Michiru.
Look at the photo.
You can probably tell what she's thinking.
We need to hurry up and find them.
There's no telling what Michiru might do...

{22}
From now on,
stay away from Miko.

{23}
Michiru? What's the matter?
It should be me!
I care much, much more about Miko!

{24}

I'm so...

I can't be like you.
It hurts. It's painful.

In your place.
Hana and Michiru
are together, right?

Michiru...

That's what you've been thinking?{edit}
I said it's quite likely—
Then,
Hana

{28-29}
will be fine.{POWER OF FRINDSHIP}

{30}
Thank you, Michiru!
Thanks for thinking of Miko!
Huh?

{31}
She'll be fine?
What are you talking about?
Were you even listening to me? Michiru's—
I was.
But Michiru
won't do anything to Hana.

{32}
Michiru's a pretty open book.
I can tell when she's happy, or having fun, or upset.
It shows on her tent—uh, in her mannerisms.{wears her heart?}
She's tried to intimidate Hana a bunch of times,
but she's never attacked her even once.
And then...
And then there's Hana.

{33}
Miko's been kind of down lately.
I can tell. There's something on her mind.
But she won't tell me about it.
So I didn't feel like I could ask.
When her dad passed away,
she put on a brave face,
so that I wouldn't worry about her.
Even though I know how sad she must've been.

{34}
That's why I always put on a brave face for her.
That's all I can do for her.
Can you help her with her problems?
sniff
I don't know what she needs,
but I trust you Michiru.
I know you can help her.

{35}
{imagine breaker sounds}
revenge!
revenge!
Huh...
rumble
All of a sudden...
I'm getting really hungry...

{36}
ruffle
mmf
A bun?
Huh?

{37}
She wasn't in the cafeteria either.
I'd better get in touch with Miko.
Aaahhh!
Nooooo!
Lil boomers?
Wait...
That's the gym storage room!
Why?

{38-39}
{owned by bread}
Huh?
Hana's pastry party.
A doughy relief package in the burnt battlefields of the storeroom.
