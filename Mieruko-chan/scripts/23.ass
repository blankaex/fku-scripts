Why are you standing out there?
ze...

DON'T LOOK {holy shit}

There goes...
My third time...

{gook runes}{kinda making some out though...}

{mask the そ in the そ〜〜〜〜 tbh}
...
Why are you just—

She really is strange.
I'm alive!!
Ah!
There she is!{She? He?}
Hana! Keep it down in the hospital!
Why are you guys here?
Sorry
H-Hana wanted to come...
Are you okay, sir?
Umm... Tanaka... Miki? Mika? {what name order did we use before?}{jp (19: "Yotsuya Miko")}
It's Yurikawa Hana!
Not even close!

I told you I was going to be fine on my own...
But you—
Hey! Look, you're crying!
I'm glad you're okay, Sir.
Please look after yourself!
It's great that you were trying to save the cat and all,
but you can't go dying in front of your students!
He didn't die, though...
Miko's been down ever since your accident.
Could you live with yourself if she was traumatized by that? Just because she happened to be there?
I wasn't there by chance, though...
Hana...
She was worried about me.

Don't say that, Hana.
Aren't you here to visit him?
But you're crying!
That's because... of something else...
He made you cry about something else too?!
...
I'm not really sure what's going on,
but I'm sorry for worrying all of you.
I said this earlier,
but I really did bring this upon myself.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'm fine, now.
Oh...

They're fading away...
Everything that was possessing him...
Is it because his Mom is gone?
Isn't that nice, Miko?
Or is it because of Hana's aura?

Hey, look!

That cloud looks delicious!
I hear they possess you if you take pity on them...
That's probably why they were following him...
Maybe he's also the kind of person who attracts them...
But in a way different to Hana...
Hey...
Sorry about the other day.
You were keeping it a secret from Hana, weren't you?
Yeah.
She gets frightened really easily.
There's still so many things I don't understand.
I can't keep up with it at all.
I might need to look into it some more.
Wanna stop by Moonbucks? {did we go with this last time}
Yeah.

One week later.
Waaah! Cattington! {need chuu2 cat name ideas. ripper or claw or some meme maybe. bil suggested nightpaw lol}
Be a good boy, okay? {surely gender doesn't matter here}
Please take good care of him.
Cattington's Food ↓
...
Are you sure?
Cattington!
Waah!
Let it go.
It's fine. Just ignore him.
...

Thank you.
I'll take good care of him.
Cattington!
Take care!
Let's go, Mocha.
meow
Oh,
Moonbu—
So Mr. Zen is gonna take care of him!

I thought he wasn't allowed to keep pets.
He said he was going to move somewhere where he could.
Wow! That's true love!
But I really can't picture him pampering a cat.
That's true.
He said he's going to leave the cat with his vet friend until he can move.
What? He has friends?
Hana... I said the exact same thing...
Oh yeah, did you invite Julia to come see My Neighbor Troll 2 with us today?
{mask the small text I guess}
I was going to, but then I decided against it.
How come?
She hasn't seen 1!
So she can't see 2!

You're pretty strict, huh, Hana?
Call it kindness!
Oh no!
We're late!
Run!
They're gonna run out of butter caramel popcorn!
_That's_ what you were worried about?

{oh shit}

Hisssss!
Come on, don't hiss at me.
I'll gouge your eyes out... Hahaha!
Tap.
