All right!

I feel like I heard Miko's voice just now...

Oh no, I tasted too much of the cake again!
Better take some from the other side to balance it out...

Hana, isn't that alcohol?
You're such a bad influence!
This was the only box I had that would fit it!
It's my dad's!
Your shirts are as cute as ever, Kyou!
Is Miko home?
She still busy?
Weren't you guys out shopping together?
No? I've been home all day, baking this cake.
Hey Sis, where you headed?
Huh?
Oh, uh... I'm going shopping with Hana.
What? {lit: but she said..."}
She hasn't seen any of my messages, and hasn't answered any of my calls either.
I wonder what she's up to.
She usually replies straight away.

Umm... Thank you for saving me.
Please accept my offering.
It'll be fine.
I'm just thanking them.

It's not fine!
A-Are they mad?
Why? What do I do? Did I get something wrong?
I have no idea!
It's over...

{18}
Pat
Are you lost?

{19}
It's the most powerful item I have!{ch6 p19}
Huh? The bracelet lady?
Didn't expect to run into you in a place like this!
Were you playing that Pokéman Go or something?
That phone game all the kids are playing.
Huh? Um...
You'll only find mosquitoes around these parts!
Do you have any insect repellent? {repels in pokemon are called insect repellent}
I can lend you some.
Oh... Uh...

{20}
We're heading that way.
Follow me.
...
They stung me all over.
I really wish they'd leave me alone.
Better keep spraying.
{mask or filler line here imo}{I vote mask}
It's not very effective, though.

{21}
She can see them...
pshh
They're not fond of this stuff.
Those "mosquitoes".
Far too many of 'em around here.
Let's head back.
O-Okay!
pshh
The real problem is those two.
I don't know if I can do anything about them.
jingle
I'll never forget the sound of those bells.

{22}
What's going on?
I can see them much more clearly than I used to be able to.

They disappeared...
Oh, I see...
So that's what it was...

{24}
Are we on the other side of the mountain?
I think we've come far enough. We should be fine now.

{25}
Phew. That scared me half to death.
U-Um...
I just came to visit the shrine...
Uh, th-there was a shrine here last time I came...
But my GPS wasn't working properly...
And then—
Calm down, girly.
I know you're confused, but I'll explain later.
...
What's your name?
Yotsuya Miko...
Miko.

{26}
You're amazing.
So young, yet so brave.
I'm impressed.
Anyway, let's find some place to rest. I bet you're hungry.
...
You okay with Benny's?
Someone who understands.
She's not here either!
You're the only person I know who would go MD hopping!
No way!
We're looking somewhere else!
Okay!
Godmother is back.
