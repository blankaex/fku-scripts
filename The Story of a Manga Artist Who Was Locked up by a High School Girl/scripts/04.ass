I went ahead and drew you, just like you asked.
What do you think?
...
Take off your clothes?
What? Why?

02
Is she upset?
Hurry up.
But why would she want me to take off my clothes?
Uhh... I can't with all these chains on me.
True. All right.
Now there should be no problem.

03
All right, fine...
Pants too.
Pants too?
Come.
She's never treated me this badly before.
She must've really hated that drawing...
Huh? The bathroom?
What's she going to do?

04
Oh...
That's what she meant.
And she's washing my clothes for me too.
Wait, does that mean she liked my drawing?
How long has it been?
I can't remember the last time I was able to make someone happy with my art.
