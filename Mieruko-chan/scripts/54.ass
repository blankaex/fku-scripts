H-Hana, are you okay?
she's so heavy
Zorry... I just got dizzy all of a sudden.
But I had some bread so I should be fine.
Michiru saved my life.
She's the best!
Emergency Bread was Super Effective!

{2}
Michiru!
Oh!
Michiru's sister?
And Miko?
Hey!
Hana, what's wrong?
Hehe, I'm fine!
Just a little bit of a food coma.
ugh...
{mask}
I was worried because I couldn't get in touch with you.
Oh, sorry.
The gym storage room has really bad reception.

{3}
Michiru!
Hello...
What were you lot doing in the gym storage room?
Oh, Mr. Zen!
Didn't see you there.
We were, uh...
From now on, stay away from Miko.{ch53p21}
I'll support Miko.{ch53p25}
Me.{ch53p25}
In your stead.{ch53p25}

{4}
We were cleaning up!
Cleaning?
Yeah, uhh...
I forgot to clean up after gym class,
so I got Michiru to come help.
Cleaning up... The little boomers?
Right, Michiru?
I was—

{5}
Michiru?
Oh!
My photo!
...
I'm sorry, Miko.
I took your photo without asking.

{6}
Look at it now.
It's all ruined.
Oh...
...
It's happening again.

{7}
Huh, that's weird.
What's up?
I can't find it.
Find what?
My mechanical pencil.
Who cares, just get another one.
No way!
That one was my favorite!
...
Hello.
I'll find it for you.

{8}
It's fine!
Michiru!
Stop it!
We don't even know for sure that someone stole it!
I'm sure we'll find it soon...
Just stop already!
Ow!

{9}
...
Are you okay?{didn't see that one coming a year and a half ago... why do people still read this}{never a villain, always misunderstood}
I'm so—
God...
You're such a freak.

{10}
Michiru...
Let's go home.

{11}
{mask}
sniff
Michiru's been hurt again...
Sorry for the trouble everyone.
That'll be it for us.
We'll be fine.
See you all.
Mi—

{12}
Hey.
Let's take a photo.

{13}
God...
You're such a freak.
Come on, I'll take it.
Bunch up, everyone!
Hey! Hana!
Mi—

{14}
What's the harm?
Get closer!
Looking good!

{15}
Hey, Hana?
I'll take the photo.
You get in too.
Huh?
Don't worry, I won't cover it up!
Uhh...
Yeah... But...{why is everyone in this show so violent}
!
M-Michiru?

{16}
...
All right.
Say cheese!
squish
Huh?
The tentacles!
wiggle
wiggle
They're retracting?

{17}
Miko, this way!
Huh?
Oh yeah!
snap{absolutely mogged}
Wow, what a great photo!
Check it out, guys!
{mask?}

{18}
Her face...

{19}
I can see her face!
What's the matter, Miko?
She's so pretty! Her eyelashes are so long!
There's still some tentacly bits left though...
{Z}Damn...
?
I'll send this to everyone!{why's the bubble under the tree}
...

{20}
I'm still scared.
What if Michiru hurts somebody again?
Or gets hurt again?
Sticking together despite that
is what friends are for, aren't they?{murderer out here about to drop a spongebob song on us}
Do you have any friends, Mr. Tohno?
I think so.
Must be nice.{awful character}
...

{21}
I've only ever thought about Michiru,
so I never considered it.
...
Why don't you give it a try, then?
All right. Will you be my friend?
...
Do you like cats?
Enough to have a cat folder, I guess?
I see.
The premonition of cat buddies.

{22}
Hey guys!
Shindou Romm here!
Enigma Syndrome!
Let's get down to business! I go to a lot of haunted places,
so my shoulders have been terribly stiff lately.
I've got about ten ghosts haunting me at the moment.
See them?
Can you believe it?
hahaha

{23}
But I've got just the thing!
Let me take you to an amazing power spot.
But before that, don't forget to subscribe.
And hit the like button while you're down there!
Uh, Romm?
What the heck is this?
Weren't you going to tell me about Michiru's tentacles?
Don't be so hasty, my dear Miko.

{24}
This is a video from about two years ago,
but I think it'd be faster if you just gave it a watch.
Oh, I did say drinks were on me,
but if you want anything else
you're paying for yourself, okay?
Uh, sure.
We're almost there!
What was that? You wanna know where this is?
Just follow the link in the description and sign up to become a member!
Ill post the location as a member exclusive!

there's so much shilling...

{25}
Here we are! The secret power spot!
This tree is over 500 years old!
Very magnificent, isn't it?
This tree is packed full of power,
so it'll have you feeling great in no time.
Even if you're haunted!{any ghost puns here}{Gonna need lit.}
hahaha

{26}


{27}
Huh? I know this!
It's just like Michiru.
Whoa.
And now thanks to the tree,
I'm feeling nice and refreshed!
The weight on my shoulders feels like it was never even there!

{28}
What is this?
Hmm...
Some kind of spirit, or lord of the forest, I suppose.
The kind that you'd see in a Mhibli movie.
You suppose?
They show up around sacred trees, and deep in forests.
There are stories of them appearing as animals and insects,
but I suspect the thing haunting your friend is something of this nature.
Though it's pretty rare for them to be following people around.
Will she be okay?
Sounds pretty serious.
From the look of it, they're already quite closely linked.
In fact, it might be better to say it's protecting her.

{29}
What happened after that?
Uhh... It kinda... Shrank away?
Shrank?
It used to cover her whole upper half,
but now there's just a couple of tentacles peeking out.
If the tentacles respond to her emotions,
then I'd say that's due to a change in her mentality.
Maybe it decided that it no longer needed to cover her to protect her?
Perhaps some great burden of hers has been lifted.
...

{30}
I hope that's the case.
Anyway,
that's all I have to say about Ichijou Michuru.
Hope that was helpful.
Thanks, Romm.
You're always helping me out like this.
Now I don't need to worry—
All right.
Now to more pressing matters.
Huh?

{31}
What's this?
An envelope?
Please open it without letting me see it.
I had you send me some photos a while back.
flip
This is one of those. Do you remember?
And what's so special about this—

{32}
Huh?
This guy again?

{33}
I didn't notice when I took the photo...
Romm, this photo—
Sorry.
I can no longer look at that photo.
It's already caught on.
Huh?

{34}
If I see that photo again,
I'll likely die.
Wha—
...

{35}
Umm...
Is it really that bad?
It's just an unassuming middle-aged guy.{better be careful what we use here for future shorthand references}
...
Unassuming middle-aged guy?
Is that how it looks to you?
What?
An unexpected and unknown... thing?
