You mustn't think about the hands.

phew
Were those Michiru's tentacles?
It was too dark to tell.
I'm glad I didn't check.
Things might have gotten awkward if it had been something else.

Miss Yotsuya?
It's time for breakfast!
Did you sleep well?
L-Like a baby...{waking up every 2 hrs and crying :^)}
Yeah, I'd better just mind my own business from now on.
You're going to be discharged today!
I'm so glad there was nothing wrong with you.
The doctor will drop by for one last check-up later—
Okay.
Before he gets here—

Thank you.
Miko, let's get tacos!
We need to celebrate your freedom!
You like crispwraps, right?
Yeah.
Do you want Taco Gong or Shipotle?
Whatever you want.

{6}
We can get churros too!
Haha, he's so excited.
Kyousuke was really worried about you.
He'd pray at Dad's altar before bed each night,{Wasn't she only there one night?}
asking him to help you get better.
If there's anything on your mind,
you can talk to me, okay?
Huh?
Come on, you think I can't tell when something's bothering you?
...

{7}
I'm your mom, after all.
Yeah.
I can wait until you're ready to talk.{How many more volumes till Miko actually talks about her problems}
Hey, Mom?
Yeah?
Thanks.
Just doing my job.
GUYS!! TACOS!!!

{8}
How'd you survive getting run over by a truck?
I didn't get run over...
Can I see the scar from your operation?
I didn't have surgery...
LISTEN HERE YOU RUBBERNECKS!
Miko just got out of hospital! Give her some space!
Aw, Hana...
If you have any questions, you can come to me!
Why you?
Let's go to MD's after school to celebrate your discharge!
Or would you rather get ice cream?
{mask}
Can we please give the sorbet a rest...

{9}
{lmao that face}
Oh, Chiruru!
Good mor—

{10}
Yotsuya...
I'm so glad you're all right.
...{not a yuri manga btw}

{11}
Hello...{LMAO}
Thanks...
I tried to come and visit, but they wouldn't let me in.
I was so worried.
...
S-So you didn't come to my hospital room?
Huh?
Wh-What the heck am I saying?

{12}
Of course not.{michiru sussy baka}
Right, yeah... Sorry, dunno why I asked...
It must've been a different monster.
What reason would Michiru have to hide under my bed?{WHAT REASON INDEED *eats pencil*}
Hey Michiru!
We're going to MD's after school to celebrate Miko's recovery.
Wanna come?
Hmm...

{13}
Oh sorry, you don't eat donuts do you?
I'd love to go to MD's.
Wow, really?
Then it's a date!
Let me go find Julia!
{mrs dornut}
Now that we're all here...
CONGRATULATIONS{anal bead ponderings best donut}
MIKO{was gonna reverse the order of the flags but I guess it doesn't matter}
Congratulations on your recovery, Miko!

{14}
Hana... What the heck is this?
This is so embarrassing...
It's your Congratulatower for getting out of hospital!
Whoa!
Is this even on the menu?
It was a special order!
I'm a regular here so they made it just for me!
Anything for you, Hana.
Heck yeah!
Just how much money do they make off you?
Wait, where's Michiru?
Oh, she said she was going to get changed first,
because she didn't want to stand out.
Must be tough being a model.
...{must be tough being a mushroom}

{15}
Sorry to keep you waiting.
She's totally standing out!

{16}
Wow Michiru, you look so strong!
Congratulations on your discharge, Yotsuya.
Th-Thanks...
Miko Vision{c40 "Miko Vision", c41 "Miko vision."}
There's something sticking out of her head...{*tips fedora*}
Those flowers are so pretty.
...
?{LMAO}
M-Michiru?
W-Would you like to sit here?{how is mush the only one with iq above room temp now}
...

{17}
Thank you.
...
I'm gonna go get another drink!
Do you want anything, Michiru?
No thank you.
Okay! You guys can start on the Congratulatower!
Don't hold back!
It's on me!
{smooth}

{18}
Uhh...
Would you tell me about her?{c42 p4}
Everything.{c42 p4}
What's her biggest secret?{c42 p5}
What was she even trying to do?
Did she really catch on to Miko's powers?
Wait a second...
Does that mean she's a medium too?!
L-Let's have some donuts!
Oh yeah, good idea.
I need to eat a lot to catch up...
{mask the small text}
...

{19}
Guys, look!
It's their new pumpkin pudding caramel parfait!
Huh? But we already have the tower...
It's fine!
This goes into a separate stomach!

Oh, it's a tiny old—{F}
Eat up, Julia!
Yeah, thanks.

...
You're not eating, Michiru?
Watching your weight?
I'm not hungry.
I just ate.{spooky. italicise "just"?}{Sure}
She just ate?{italics on "just"}
Romm said the monster was probably on top of her,
chomp
but why does she have a tentacle monster on her in the first place?
I-Is she looking at me?
...
Is that also a donut?
Huh?
Yeah.
It's an amen ring.

{21}
Would you like some?{tfw miko will never feed you her amen ring ;;7}{amen}
Could I have that small piece?
Huh?
slip{michiru with the strong covid precautions}

{22}
Aahh
...
Does she want me to feed her?
Wh-Where the heck is her mouth?
If that thing sticking out is a hat...
squelch
M-Maybe here?

{23}
squish{LMFAO}
Hmm...
This doesn't feel right...
A bit more to the left... Oh, there's her lip!
Must be here, then...
pfft
Hey, Miko!
What are you doing?
Huh?
Oh, sorry!
I just shoved it in her mouth!{;;7}

{24}
Are...
Are you okay?

That was delicious.
Miko, I love your...

{25}
Michiru, there's donut all over your face!
You look like a clown!
...
You're one to talk, Hana...
...
Julia, what happened? You're soaked!
{mask?}
Uhh, yeah...
I can't see anything but it sounds like I made a mess...
hahaha...
Uhh...

Payback.
Hehehe.

{26}

Mm...
Hahaha! What's even happening?
hahaha
Miko! Your face!
Uhh...
Hahaha...
hehehehe
Her tentacles are wriggling about...
I guess she's happy?
Hey guys, let's take a photo.
Would you like me to take it for you?
Oh, would you? Thanks!
Say cheese!

{27-28}

Here you go.
Wow, thank—
Hmm?
Hey,
Michiru's not in the photo...
Is that your finger?
Sorry about that.

{29}
{mask right bubble}
Unsanctioned photos of my sister aren't allowed.
Huh? Sister?
Michiru, you have a sister?
Thanks for being friends with her.
I'm Michiru's older sister, and her manager.

{30}
Come on, Michiru!
You know you're meant to decline photos!
I can't leave you alone for five minutes, can I?
And you certainly can't be eating donuts, either!
You need to learn to resist the temptation of sugar and oil and flour!
Otherwise you're going to grow into an adult who can't look after herself.
Think about the consequences of your actions a little more!
slip{this kills the fatty}
She put it back...
I have to get going.
Huh?
I've got work after this.
A-Are you okay, Michiru?

{31}
?
Why wouldn't I be?
No—
No reason...
Is that a threat?
Two completely different sisters. What's really going on in Michiru's head?
