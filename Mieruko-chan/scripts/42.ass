How strange.
I've just moved schools,
and I haven't really opened up to anybody,
but I feel like I can be myself when I'm around you, Niguredou.
Mieruko-chan
Be herself?
Girls usually go to the bathroom together, right?
I've always wanted to try it!
hehehe
I don't think this is what they usually do...
Not that I'd know...
Julia taken away, feeling somewhat smaller than usual.

{2}
Do you like caterpillars?
Huh?
You like mushrooms, right?
How about caterpillars?
I-I don't dislike them, I guess...
Wonderful!
I love them too!
Don't you think caterpillars and mushrooms go well together?
...
I do.
So we'll probably get along great.

{3}
Why do I feel so intimidated?
Because I'm short?
Hey...
Do you wanna talk outside?
It's kinda cramped in here.
It's fine.
Wtf...
Niguredo,

{4}
Would you tell me about Yotsuya?
Huh?
Miko?
Wh-
What do you wanna know?
Everything.

{5}
What's her favorite food?
Umm...
I think it might've been pudding?
Favorite color?
Uhh... Maybe blue?
I think...
Is she dating anyone?
I don't think so...
What are her hobbies?
I-I dunno...
Her birthday?
N-Not sure...
What does she wash first in the shower?
Huh? Dunno...
What's her address?
I don't know...
Are you hiding something from me?
Glare

{6}
Wait, is she catching on to Miko's powers?
No, it can't be...
Umm...
No...{tfw it wasn't the shroom}
I see.
Thank you.
!
That was a fun little chat.

{7}
What the heck was that about?
And why was she eating the pencil?
Oh, right.
Eek!
I won't tell anyone about the pen—
Would there be a copy of the class register in the staff room?
Huh?
Let's chat again some time.
Goodbye, Niguredou.

Yotsuya
Combustible
Non-combustible
This is it.
That's Miko's room.

{9}
Hehehe
I just saw her silhouette!
I wonder if she's in her pyjamas?
Oh.
Is she going to sleep?

{10}
{holy shit}
fwoosh

{11}
...
No, she probably wouldn't want guests at this hour.
Maybe...
Maybe once we get to know each other better.

{12}

{14}
Why do I feel like I've had an utterly terrifying nightmare?
What was it?
I can't remember...
Hey sis, wakey wakey.
Kyousuke! I told you to knock!
It's a cold one today.

{15}
Sheesh...{grumpy miko}
Pudding?
Melt-in-your-mouth
PUDDING
gooey and delicious
chestnut
Melt-in-your-mouth
PUDDING
gooey and delicious
...
Did Kyousuke leave this for me?
Was it really a dream?

{16}
Wow, I wish I found a pudding next to my bed this morning!{based fatty}
No way, it was creepy as heck!
You sure you didn't buy it without noticing?
I think you need to learn to control yourself better.
So what did you do with the pudding?
I mean, obviously—

{17}
clack
Whoa,
Chiruru!
It's really her!
Wow Michiru, you look great!
!
Good morning,
MIKO
and Yurikawa.

{18}
Am I watching Paris Fashion Week?
Am I watching Paris Fashion Week?{lmfao}
Cold today, isn't it?
Oopsies!
Y-Yeah...
Huh? She has a Meme.
Hey, do you like Meme by any—
I do.
We match, don't we?
Quick response...

{19}
I have Lambda Rabbit!{based brainlet}
Guess I match with Miko too!
Miko's one is kinda creepy though.
Hehehe
I see.
Do you want one, Michiru?
I'm good.
Come on, what is it this time?
M-Meme's great, right?
I'm glad to hear you like Lolol.
I'm also glad.
phew

{20}
Do you always get driven to school, Michiru?
Yes.
Wow, lucky!
nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
What the heck is going on?
Is she sucking up my life aura?
Wouldn't she go for Hana, then?
Oh, I guess you can't use the trains.
People would probably notice you.

{21}
Did I do something bad in a past life?
Hey Michiru, do you eat at MD's?
...
No.
Omg, I can't see where I'm walking.
Oh, okay.
I heard MD's is pretty low-calorie.
I see.
Hana seems to be doing okay.
I guess Michiru doesn't seem too interested in her.
But I gotta do something about these tentacles...
Oh, a cat!
Huh?
S-Stop!
I'm free!

{22}
Miko!{damn actual isekai page}
A small setback in her grand plan.
Miko!!
