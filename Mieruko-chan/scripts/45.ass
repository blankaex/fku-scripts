It's pretty chilly tonight.
Oh,
this one's on me.
Th—
Thanks...
Well, that was a pleasant surprise!
I've never seen anybody running to the bathroom with an expression like—
ROMM??? {excuse me?}
sigh
What are you doing in the hospital?
And in a doctor's coat at that?
A hot drink to combat the chill running down her spine.

{2}
I'm doing a bit of an investigation.
It's a pretty old hospital, you see.
So there are a lot of ghost rumors going around.
Apparently you can hear a woman's screams from the boiler room, so I went to go have a look,
but it turned out to be just the air conditioning whirring and screeching.
It's pretty strange that there was nothing going on in the boiler room, of all places!
Maybe that should be a rumor in its own right!
hahaha!
What's so funny?

{3}
Are there a lot of them around because it's a hospital?
Hospitals tend to attract more than usual, yes,
but this hospital has a particularly dense ephemeral clientele.
It's less because it's a hospital,
and more to do with the history of the land.
There might be a more complicated backstory.
Or there may be no backstory at all.
Anyway, what brings you to the hospital?
Oh, this?

{4}
Actually...
I'm glad we ran into each other.
There was something I wanted to ask you.
The transfer student looks like a monster?
Ichijou Michiru
Nickname: Chiruru
Likes: Lolol, caterpillars

{5}
She hasn't actually hurt anyone,
and Hana seems to be fine around her too,
but I'm not sure what I should do around her.
...
I see.{DO YOU REALLY}
And she looks like a monster to you in this photo as well?
Yeah.
Huh?
She doesn't for you?
Well, everybody has a different way of "seeing",{as in ghost seeing}
but I'd hazard to say we're seeing something different.

{6}
Take this window.
You should be able to see my reflection in the glass.
But you should also be able to see the scenery outside.
tap
My reflection is overlaid on top of the scenery,
but you should be able to see both.
That's how I "see" them.

{7}
"I just see a faint shadow." "I can see them clearly."
"They look exactly the same." "They look completely different."
"I can see this one, but I can't see that one."
I think in your case, Miko,
the reflection in the glass is overpowering,
and you're unable to see what lies beyond.
If there's a monster on top of a person,
then you won't be able to see the person underneath.

{8}
What does that mean?
Michiru is being possessed by a monster?
That's an interesting idea.
Have you ever seen anyone being possessed?
Yeah...
I think so.
I feel like this might be the case,
though it's hard to say just by looking at this photo.
Would you be able to take some photos of her for me?
As many as you can.

{9}
Huh?
Me?
Indeed.
I would get arrested if I tried a stunt like that.
I'll see what I can dig up on my end as well,
but I'm actually a lot busier than I look.
I've still got this investigation going on.
I'm also planning to do a 24-hour stream to beat this horror game.{* edit note}
You don't sound busy at all.
Anyway—

mmf
My food...

{10}
Oh,
that's my roommate.
Is he looking for the toilet?
It's room 303.
Quick.{F for dementia man}

{11}
Miko, wait.
hahh
hahh
It was Mr. Sasaki.
His condition suddenly took a turn for the worse.

{12}


{13}
Where is he headed?
...
Is he just going to keep wandering around?
In this hospital, forever?

{14}
{F again}

{15}
Michiko...
Chi...

{16}
Chiharu!
We can finally hold hands!

{17}
Hi, dad.{????}
Hey, can you see them?
My dad is, though.{might need to modify this quote so it makes sense standalone}
They said he can come home soon.

{18}
Chi...
haru?
Michiko...

{19}
aahhh...
Chiharu...
Michiko...
aaaaahhh...
aahhh...
I'm so sorry...
I couldn't...
Be there for you...

{20}
You were there the whole time.

{21}
!
Chiharu!
Don't worry.

{22-23}
gnash
We'll be fine.
gnash
He's just going to send us off.
Bye bye, girl who sees them.
It was nice meeting you!

{24-25}

-ya General Hospital
We finally managed to sort out a private room for you.
Sorry it took so long.
Thanks.
It must've been quite a fright, finding out about Mr. Sasaki.
Are you doing okay?
Ah, yeah, I'm fine.
Poor guy.
He lost his family quite a while ago.

{28}
He always looked so lonely,
but for some reason he was super energetic yesterday.
Especially when he got his food.
Normally we wouldn't have put you in the same room,
but I heard you requested room 303 specifically.
Did you have a reason for that?
Your room is just down the corridor—
join us
join us
C-C-
Can I have another room??
This one! I want this one!
Huh? But—
I don't mind.

{29}
Umm...
Yeah...
All the other rooms were occupied.
Occupied?
How hard did she hit her head?{tfw brain damaged miko}
I hope her tests go okay...

{30}
You're going home tomorrow?
Yeah.
That's great news!
Sorry for worrying you.
I'll bring over that sorbet you wanted!{10 years to remember what we memed this into}
Ah, yeah, don't worry about that.
Huh? How come?
Oh,
sorry I gotta hang up.
What? Why—
beep
What should I do?
Going forward...
What do you mean?

{31}
I spoke to Chiharu.
That was the first time I spoke to one of them.
So I was thinking...
Since nothing bad happened,
maybe we could come to an understanding.
Excellent idea! You might even be able to help people out while you're at it!
But do you think you can distinguish between the ones you should and shouldn't speak to?
You seem to have a tough time even telling them apart from humans.

{32}
Mrs. Mitsue and I have been able to see them from the day we were born.
From our years of experience, we've developed a bit of a knack.
At times, we can tell which ones are safe to talk to.
But that's not the case for you.
There's no reason for you to come to this side.
And you'd be a tough competitor in this business, too!
hahaha!

{33}
Yotsuya Miko
{mask}
sigh
It's not like I asked to be able to see them.
...
But there has to be something I can do.

{34}
Whoa!
Calm down, granny...
You almost gave me a heart attack.
She's saying something...

{35}
...
Do you think you can distinguish
between the ones you should and shouldn't speak to?
...
All right.
H-Hi.
Can I...
Help you?
...

{36-37}
AAAAAAA{lmfao get fucked}

{38}
Huh?
aaarrgghhh

{39}
Huh?
I recognize these tentacles...

{40}

...

What...{LOOOOLL}
Under the bed?
Saved from a predicament by some familiar tentacles.
