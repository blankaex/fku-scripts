Her fantasies run wild.{lit: enjoying the girl under her eyelids to the fullest}

{2}
Michiru, was that a smile I saw?
*smug*
Did something fun happen?
Let your big sister in on the gossip!
No, You.
Nothing happened.

{3}
—and you were about to fall,
so I ran over to catch you but I ended up falling too!
Hahaha!
Do you remember?
Yeah.
And then you went and—
Oh, and do you remember that one time when—

{4}
Combing your hair is so relaxing.
How's school?
All good?
Yeah.

{5}
That's good.
Who were those girls at MD's today?
Your friends?
Classmates.

{6}
Oh!
They're just classmates!
Don't forget to let me know
the next time you go hang out with someone.
Don't forget I'm your manager.
I can't do my job if you don't tell me these things.

{7}
You know,
I'm really, really worried about you, Michiru.
I'm sure re tired of hearing it.
But you're my one and only little sister.
Talk to me, okay?
You can tell me about anything you want.
Okay.

{8}
I will.
Thanks, You.
Sure thing!
See you tomorrow, then!
Bye, Michiru.

{9}
Good night.
Good night.

{10}
Hello, Pii! {c40:326}
You won't believe what happened today!
Miko is so funny!

{11}
We went to MD's today.
Do you know MD's?
It's a donut store.
So we went there,
and Miko was eating a donut.
hehehe
And you know what happened next?
She gave me some of her donut!
hehehe
It was so sweet...
Miko was so sweet...
...
hehehehehehe
I'm going to become
better and better friends with Miko.

{12-13}
{holy fuck this is scarier than all the ghosts}
Miko...

{14}
Come on!
Pass!
You got this!
Chiruru looks great no matter what she's doing!
Mood.
I feel like you could take a great photo without even trying.

{15}
Would you be able to take some photos of her for me?{c45:93}
As many as you can.{c45:94}
{mask right bubble}{c46:304}
Unsanctioned photos of my sister aren't allowed.{c46:305}
What do I do?
Chiruru, let's take a photo together!
Sorry.
I'm not allowed to.
She already turned someone down this morning.
I feel like a creep, trying to sneak a photo of her.
Shoot, Michiru! Shoot!

{16}
Miko!
Wow!
snap
Oh...

{17}
I'm dead...
That disconnect...
Deep breaths, Chie.
It looked like a good opportunity so I kind of just took it on reflex...
Michiru was pretty close, wasn't she Miko?
Y-Yeah...

{18}
I'm no good at sports.
Don't worry about it!
I can't help but feel kind of guilty about this...
But I do want to find out what that thing at MD's was all about...
And even though Hana seems to be doing fine, who knows how long things will stay that way?
Your left hand is just for support.
{mask right}
I've just got to do what I can for now.

{20}
Whoa!
These are some pretty good photos.
Maybe I'm a natural-born detective.
There was that thing with Mr. Zen as well.
Well, I probably have enough photos now.

{21}
Mission Complete.{nice vidya meme}
Guess I'll head back.
Huh?
Michiru's not with them?{oh no no no}

{22}
Huh?

{23}
Art Room
Whoa!
Mi—
blink
Michiru?
Hello, Yotsuya.

{24}
I had something I wanted to ask.
Why have you been taking photos of me all day?{F}

{25}
I'm busted!
Huh?
Oh...
Uhh...
Umm...
I think there's a monster on your head,
so I took some photos to show a medium friend of mine!
Yeah right!
There's no way I could tell her that.
What do I do?
Sorry...
Umm...
What can I say?

{26}
I remember this...
Whoa!{c41:113}
So that's how she looks to you.{c41:114}
!{c41:115}
So, umm...
You know...
I thought...

{27}
I thought you were really pretty,{not yuri manga btw}
Michiru...

{28}
ba-dump{WHY ARE THE GLOVES COMING OFF}

{29}
Sorry for not asking... I'll delete all the photos.
I don't think I can just talk my way out of this...
It's okay.
grasp
Miko...

{30}
I...
I feel the same way.{migo is finished}

{31}
Huh? What?
Huh?{tent'd}

{32}
There she is!
Hey, Chiruru!
We were looking all over for you!
Oh, Miko's here too.
Uhh...
Do you need something?
Yeah, Mr. Zen is calling for you.
He said to come to the staff room.

{33}
Okay.
Thanks.
Do you know where the staff room is? Should we take you there?
It's fine.
Let's go,
Miko!{the gf name drop}

{34}
Huh?
Hey!
Why me?
Damn, Miko!
She's so friendly with Chiruru!
I'm so jelly!
Hmm?
Kinda looks like she's being dragged away...
I'm so glad they showed up.
That might've been bad.
I'm saved...
Disturbance in the air.
Where's Miko and Michiru?
Food poisoning?
Michiru in full gear with Miko in tow.
