There's a side to the transfer student that only I can see.
{you're on your own for the rest}

Observing your model closely
is the key to portrait drawing.
Take in every detail.

{3}
How the heck
do I draw this?

{4}
You can just relax, Ichijou.
Thank you.
{mask}
Okay.
Ain't this a treat!
Who'da thunk we'd have Chiruru modeling for us?
"I wish I picked music as my elective."
"Art is boring af."
I never said that...

{5}
Hey, you two!
Cut the chit-chat!
Sorry...
Yotsuya Miko...
Miko...
She's avoiding eye contact again.
I would really love to know why.
I feel like she's looking at me...

{6}
Unlike all the other ones I've seen,
Good morning.
Miko.
O-Oh, hey!
Nice weather today!
It's cloudy.
I can't just ignore her.
But I also can't see what she actually looks like,
which makes things pretty difficult.
Hmm...
Oh right, I can just copy what Hana's drawing.{lol}

{7}
Nailed it!
Hana, your apple is too big!
Chiruru won't fit!
Shoulda known...
Oh, very good.
You've captured the texture of the apple really well.
Hehe.
But you can't just take one quick look.
It's important to observe and understand the motif as well.
Try to focus on more than just the apple.
Hehe...
...

{8}
"It's important to observe and understand"
She might be right. I've never really had the chance to take a good look.
Maybe this is a good opportunity.
Miko closed her eyes.
What an interesting girl.
Oh, Miko.
Why won't you look at me?

{9}
Chiruru really looks like a doll when she's just sitting still.
Unlike you, Chie. You can't sit still for two seconds.
Excuse me? I can too!

{10}
Her eyelashes are so long.
Her tentacles are so long.
How many does she have?
One, two, three...
Kind of like an octopus, maybe?
Damn.
What am I even drawing?
Miko vision.
Huh?
The tentacles are moving.
They're wrapping around her head?

{11}
{time to get romm's ghostbusting outfit back}

{12}
Huh?

{13}
Eyes...
{mask bubble}

{14}
Wow Shiho, yours looks so good!
Art clubbers are super talented!
So accurate!
Really?
Lemme see!
!
...
Damn!
It looks just like her!
I-I wanna see too...{meme font}
Looking closely might have been a bad idea...

{15}
Whoa!
So that's how she looks to you.
!
What do you mean?
O-Oh nothing, I just thought you drew her really well.

{16}
The heck is this, Miko?
Fried octopus?
Hey!
I-It's nothing,
I was just doodling...
...
That's not how you draw a portrait...
You're meant to draw what you see, as-is..
You can't just make it all abstract like that...
I would've done it differently if I weren't doing a portrait...
Why is Shiho getting so defensive?
Come on, back to your seats everyone.
Oh, there's the bell...
I guess that's it for today.
Done!

{17}
My apple!
Wow.
Yurikawa.
Yeah?
You can have the apple.
Huh?
Really? You sure?
plop
Yay, thanks!
...
I'd love to see your portrait, Miko.
Huh?

{18}
N-No! Sorry!
I'm really bad at drawing!
Sorry!
I was going to use that apple with my next class.
?
Forget it, you can have it.{can't beat the hana}
Th-That was close...

{19}
{hands ðŸ‘€}

{20}
Intense eye contact with Miko!{damn this sounds like an /a/ shitpost}
{split/mask somehow}
This is so strange. My body feels like it's on fire.
What could it be? What could it be?
Miko...

{21}
I want to learn more about her.{what the fuck}
I want to get closer to her.
She's eating a pencil!

{22}
Hello, Niguredou.

{23}
Umm...
Hello...
Huh?
Hey!
Huh?
Ah!
Wait!
Aahh!
clack{rip julia}

{24}
{shroomlet bullying hours}{That's 24/7}

{25}
Shall we have a little chat?

{26}
I hope Mrs. Mitsue is in tomorrow.
How come I didn't see you at lunch today, Julia?
I wasn't feeling too good.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You should eat more meat!
...
Just my imagination?
Actually, why did I even check?

{27}
It's Miko's house.
Uh oh.
There's no end to her warped passion.
