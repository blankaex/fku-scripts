{1}
I recognize this.

Mieruko-chan
It's Romm's.
squeak squeak{ch34 p26, ch34 p33}
Looks like we're back outside.
Huh? The shrine's gone?
The barrier broke down.
That's probably why we were ejected.
The shrill ringing of the bells fades.

{2}
There was something inside...
it was like, enshrined or something,
so like,
I went to pick it up,
but I think it was a human skull, and I was so scared,
I dropped it,
and it shattered,
then everything went all white,
and then—
Miko!

{3}
You're fine.
Miko {ch36 p8}
You did great.

{4}
{mask}
sniff
You don't need to hold it in anymore.
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Miko can see them,
but at the end of the day, she's just an ordinary girl.
Yeah,
you really are a strong girl.

{5}
Sorry, I just didn't know what to do.
Nobody does.
That's just what that shrine is like.
By the way,
where's Romm?
...
This way.

{6}
Long time no see.
It's Shindou Romm.
Do you remember me?
I was just a little boy the last time we met.
About this tall.
The passage of time is a cruel beast, isn't it?
Hahaha
...
Sorry.
That was in poor taste.

{7}
Just how long have you been waiting here?
Years?
Decades? Centuries?
Waiting,
for someone to hear your voice.

{8}
That's...
The girl from the shrine...{wat. How would you know from a skull?}
...

{9}
Do you remember my wish?
Please,
let me help you.
Will you grant it for me this time?{This time? Now?}

{10-11}


{12-13}


{14}


{15}
Master!
Huh?
Mrs. Towako!


{16}

{17}


{18}


{19}
If I hadn't wandered up the mountain all those years ago,
Mrs. Towako could have been out there helping someone right this very moment.
...
But if you hadn't wandered up the mountain all those years ago,
we wouldn't have been able to save Miko today.
Romm,
did you see my master's face?

{20}
She was smiling.
...
She was.

{21}
Um... Can we just leave it like that?
Like...
I kind of broke the skull and stuff...
And the shrine fell apart and everything...
It was a spectacular demolition.
Quiet, you!
You got us all out safe and sound.
Well done, Miko.

{22}
...
Miko, Hana,
Mrs. Mitsue, and Mrs. Towako...
It's thanks to everyone's help that I was able to save the girl.
I wouldn't have been able to accomplish any of this by myself.
Who was she?
A sacrifice?
Who knows?
That mountain doesn't have much literature to its name anymore.

{23}
There's only one thing I know for certain.
She was calling out for help.
Romm.
You need to learn to ask for help yourself.
I'm your master.
You can count on me.
...
I thought you didn't have any apprentices.

{24}
I christened you Shindou Romm.
Can't do much about that now.
...
You never asked me to reciprocate.
Should I start calling you "Godmother"?
Call me Mrs. Mitsue, you dolt.
If Hana's not in danger anymore,
squeeze
then I should just leave it at that.

{25}
Man, I'm beat.
Why don't we stop by Benny's?
I'd better not, my family would get worried.
Ah, all right.
I'll take you up on that offer, Master.
Don't expect me to pay.

{26}
?
What was that?
Something appeared.

{27}
Mmh!
What a wonderful morning!
Morning, Hana.
Hey Miko!
What do we have here?

{28}
The heck is this?
Lambda Rabbit?
Yeah.
I found it.
Isn't it cute?
Uh...
It's kinda scary...
This is proof that I made it out of that shrine.
I stuffed it with the stone that Romm gave me.
It's a good luck charm.

{29}
You know, I've been thinking lately,
one of my Lambda Rabbits looks a bit different...{did we abbreviate this before?}{Nope}
This one.
*gulp*
She's a sharp one, this Lambda Rabbit die-hard.
Looks the same to me!
Anyway let's get to class!
Hey, don't push!
I'm gonna fall!
Everything worked out okay at the shrine,
but I need to be ready for anything.
Sheesh!
Haha, sorry.
step
Oh yeah, I found this scrumptious-looking bun earlier!{the hell is up with her bag straps}
badump

{30}

{31}
{mask right}
No, not this one...
And they're already showing up again...
Oh no, it's coming this way!
It's so close!
step
step
This is nothing compared to the shrine.
I'll be fine.
It won't run into Hana if it keeps going this way.
Deep breath.
I'll—

{32}
!
Thump?

{33}
?{taking camera angle lessons from the anime I see}
Miko, are you okay?
Uh...
Yeah!
You gotta watch where you're going.
What?
Yep. Looking ahead.
That's all.
Yep.
Why are you talking like that?
What just happened?
I thought it would pass right through me.
Did I bump into a pillar?
No, it didn't feel like concrete at all...
Miko, you should apologize for bumping into her.
Huh?

{34}
No,
it was my fault.
???
What?!

{35}
Sorry, Miko's such a klutz.
Hana can see it?
!
H-Hana!
Whoa!
Huh?
We need to get outta here!
huff
Miko!
Stop!
Miko?
Miko!
Come on, I know how much you love me,
but you can't be getting all jealous
the moment I start talking to a pretty girl.
Uh...
What?
Is she the transfer student?
She's so pretty!

{36}
I love her hair!
And she's so tall!
Transfer "student."
All I see is a monster...
Difficulty spike.
