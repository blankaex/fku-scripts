Victory melon moment to fry the monsters.
Wow!
This takes me back!
{mask}
This was the three-legged race!
We won, remember?

It's kind of burning up... Because of Hana's aura?
I really worked up an appetite!
Maybe because of all the exercise?
That's some crazy aura.
(Miko is) so cute.
Haha, thanks!
I've never looked back like this,
but it seems I can see them even in old photos.
There's quite a lot of them...

{4}
Haha Miko you look so goofy!
Speak for yourself.
Ah small Miko is so cute too!
Yurikawa is kind of in the way.
I wonder if she'll let me keep a few? I'm sure she will.
She took photos of me, after all.
I want photos of her too!
This one's so funny!
{mask}
I can feel her glare!

{5}
I know they're pretty attracted to Hana,
omg I remember this too!
but I guess they've always just been around.
I can't even enjoy my childhood photos anymore.
This kinda sucks.

Wow it's really pouring out there!
It was barely even sprinkling before...
Looks like it'll be heavy all night.
Some train lines will also be temporarily suspended—
What? They're stopping the trains?
Why don't you guys just stay over?
It's Sunday tomorrow, after all.
!

{12}
Yeah, it'd be pretty dangerous to send you all out in this weather.
I don't mind if your parents are fine with it.
Yay, sleepover!
Woohoo!
Yeah... At a friend's house...
Yeah, Miko's!
Hey, You?
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah.
It's raining really hard outside, so I'll be staying at a friend's house tonight.
...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

{13}
Can I speak to her, Michiru?
I should say hi—
It's fine.
Are you sure? I should really—
My sister is busy at the moment
and had to hang up straight away.
I'll let her know you said hi.
...

Well, okay.
Let me speak with her later, okay?
All right.

{14}
Her sister was fine with it?
I'll go and draw a bath, then.
Okay.
Oh, I-I don't have a change of clothes.
I have some underwear I bought recently that I haven't worn yet.
You still have the pajamas I normally wear when I stay over?
!
Normally wear...
Wanna take a bath together, lil Kyo?
Hell no!
Don't be shy!

I'm looking forward to it
so much.
