I took a bite of the ice cream.
Wait, where did that other bite come from?

Phew.
Hey Mitsue!
Hard at work again today, I see!

You getting used to working out in the fields?
Not as easy as that crystal selling business, huh?
Hah, you must be joking.
This is just what I needed to get back in shape.
I'm really glad that you're back.
Are you planning to stay?
...
Yeah. I've turned over a new leaf.
Mom!
Let's take a break!

Your son has grown into such a fine, young man.
...
Yeah.
You don't actually want to stay here, do you?
Your fortunes were always spot-on.
Give it a rest. That's all in the past.
My powers aren't what they used to be.
There's no fighting old age.
Then why do you keep wandering deep into the mountains?
...

Who're you talking to, Mom?
!
...
Nobody.
You always said I'd kick the bucket if I didn't lay off the booze.
And what do you know, your fortune was spot-on.
I didn't need to be a medium to tell you that.
You're a good person deep down.
Won't you do me one last favor?

It's not your fault.
I'm so sorry that you had to go through this.
Dad...
Thank you.
Thank you, Mitsue.

Back in the mountains again...
I used to come here often to focus my power.

What's going on?
I feel much more powerful than I did back in the day.
Ever since I met that girl...
Or maybe I'm just inching closer to the other side.
There's a letter for you, Mom.
A letter? From who?
Not sure, there's no sender on the envelope.

What can you see?
"What can"
"you see?"
I recognize this handwriting.
It looks like there's a photo on the back.
What can
you see?
!
—n you see?

It's a pair of girls. Are they at a shrine?
It looks like a Tweeter photo.

Impossible! I can't believe it!
Mom? What's wrong?
Hey! Mom! Where are you going?
What's this photo all about?
...
That shrine...

Doesn't exist.
Huh?
I won't be back for a while.
Even though her face was hidden, I could tell it was her from her aura.
There's no one else it could be.
What a twist of fate.

The Godmother
is back in business.
I need to hurry back.
Before it's too late.

My Neighbor Troll 2
Best seats in the house!
That's way too much popcorn...
I got it for us to share!
I wasn't gonna eat it all myself!
You sure you're not throwing a party?
I've gotta get my sustenance otherwise I won't make it through the entire movie.
Were movies always this much of a struggle?
