Countless heads raised,
drowsily waiting
for her to cry

I cry
and cry

and cry
and cry
and I still haven't cried enough

Stones might all look the same, but they're all unique.
Some of them have a bit of a glimmer, shall we say? It's a bit like the stone is trying to tell you something.
I'll teach you how to tell apart the powerful stones from the—
Did you hear that?
Just now.

Romm.
Listen closely. This is important.
Never ever set foot near that mountain.
I don't care what you hear. Don't do it.
Understood?
All right.

He can see things that I can't.
He can hear things that I can't.
I'm supposed to help him,
but I don't know what to do.
I'm not good enough to be his master.
You've always been like this.
Ever since we met.

I made up my mind to do whatever I could to support those children.
Be it running a shady fortune telling store or whatever.
The children that come to us aren't like the rest.
They're full of feelings with nobody to confide in.
They need help more than anyone.
You've worked so hard for this, but you only ever have the children in mind.
You need to look out for yourself too.

{8}
You're acting like you're their mother.
Oh, that brings me back!
I mean, sure...
But it still feels weird calling myself "Godmother" in front of him.
You might be right, though.
I might have been taking advantage of you.
That child is extremely talented. He needs someone to guide him.
It was my job to show him the way.
But I just made excuses, like being busy with my TV work.
I can't believe myself.
It's not you who's not good enough. It's me.
I'm getting mad at myself just thinking about it.

{9}
I'll take care of things.
Just leave it with me.
...
No.
I said I'd look after him.
He's my apprentice now.
He'll definitely go back to the mountain.
He might wander into an even more dangerous area next time.
If that happens...

Well, hello there.

Is this smoke?

{20}
Miko! Are you all right?
I'm fine...
What's this?
...
It's insect repellant.
Also it's not very good for you, so try not to breathe too much of it in.
! {lmao her face}
What did you do?

{21}
Mrs. Mitsue, Miko,
I think it would be in our best interests
to get out of here while we still can.
!
The barrier has been weakened.
Mrs. Mitsue, you should be powerful enough to pass through now. {while it's weakened}
Not to worry, Miko.
I won't be charging for this service.
Aren't you glad to hear that?
Huh?
What do you mean?
What are you planning to do?
There's no time. You'll need to get out of here quickly—

{22}
I'm tired of your shit, Romm.
...

{23}
All those years ago,
that bell was given to me.
It was stolen, so I came to take it back.
That's all there is to it.
Wha—
Thank you for your help.

{24}
If you'll excuse me.
Goodbye.
Go, quick.

It made my mind go all blank earlier... {:^)}
And not in a good way...
Mrs. Mitsue?
thud
... {actually F}

{31}
What are you doing? {oh not ded still}
You need to get Miko out of—
Quiet.

{32}
I'm your master.
A master would never leave her apprentice behind.
Mrs. Mitsue!
Romm!
!
Romm...
Take Miko and get out of here.
Understood?

{34}
Mitsue?
Yeah?
Remember that chat we had the other day?
Did you have some time to think about it?
Oh, about becoming your apprentice?
Yes, that.
Hmm... I'm not too sure.
Still thinking, huh?
What's holding you back?

{35}
I'm sure you'll be able to help plenty of people in the future.
Trust me.
No, it's not that...
I don't like the name you gave me.
Can I have another one?
I'm not budging on that one.
It's perfect for you!
Come on...
You're the apprentice,
"Godmother",
and I'm the master,
"Oka Towako".
