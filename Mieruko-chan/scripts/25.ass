An upgrade you wouldn't even notice.

Miko, look! There's a new Lambda Rabbit!
Lambda Rabbit

Limited Availability {lit limited to certain/physical stores}
Special
{Locati}on {or something idk, maybe just leave this out}
He's so cute!
Look at his face!
I honestly can't tell the difference.
Mieruko-chan.
Look, this is the old one!
And this is the new one!
See?
They look exactly the same.
Back to your seats please, everyone.
Let's start homeroom.

A suspicious-looking person has been spotted loitering outside school grounds lately.
Make sure to keep an eye out when you go home.
Seriously?
Gross!
Oh no, that's terrifying!
Mr. Zen, can you walk me home?
That's all for today's homeroom.
See you all tomorrow.
Wow he totally ignored you.
He still won't say anything to me...
Don't let it get to you.
Let's go home, Miko!
Sure.
So I thought it was a dumpling but when I poked it to check, it was actually a rock!
What were you planning to do if it actually was a dumpling?

What's the matter?
Forget something?
N-No...

I keep hearing those bells lately...

THREE TIMES
Should I visit the shrine again to say thanks?
They've already saved me three times.
Hey Hana, what do you think would be a good offering?
Offering?
Dumplings would be nice!
I didn't mean for you.
Lambda Rabbit
One per person, please!
Only while stocks last!

Let me quickly go buy one.
Sure.
Just wait over there for me!
Excuse me. {this is like an excuse me for sitting down next to you, not excuse me can I talk to you}

Huh? What?
Why is he staring at me? He's so creepy...
...
He's a person, right?
Oh, right!

Hello, there!
Ew!
Excuse me, young lady.
Would you like a stone?
What the heck? That's so creepy!
They come in a variety of different shapes.
What's with this guy?
Where are you, Hana?

Which one would you like?
I-I'm good, thanks.
Miko...
Hana!
I was betrayed and tossed aside...
It was terrible! They said they don't know when there'll be more stock!
Calm down!
What's the matter? Something on your mind?
Who's that?
Someone you know?

Rom the Prodigy...
Oh!
That's me!
Hahaha!
He's so creepy...
How did he send this to everyone?
Airdrop?
Let's go, Hana. You can buy the rabbit when they come back in stock.
Okay...

Hey! How did you get that?
Hmm?
Oh.
There were some people lining up, so I joined the line for fun and ended up with it.
What is it?
It looks like it'd make a good voodoo doll.
If you don't want it, may I have it?
Wait!
Hana!
I really, really want it!
But of course.
Which stone would you like?
yoink
Huh?
Stone?
I bet Hana would fall for every pyramid scheme out there.

Take a good look.
Aren't the cute?
They're very nice stones.
They're filled to the brim with power.
Let's go!
Come on, Hana!
Huh? But my Lambda Rabbit...
I'll buy you ten donuts!
Oh, you don't want the doll?
Sorry, we're in a hurry.
Lambda Rabbit... Or MD's...

We're good, thank you!
What are you doing? That was obviously a pyramid scheme!
Get it together!

Give me back the Lambda Rabbit.
Here's $5.
Huh? Uh, okay...
Wait, give it _back_?
You said I could have it!
That was close! Let's get out of here!
Hurry, Miko! MD's is waiting!
Huh? Uh...
Wait,
I still have this.
You can keep it.
I have a feeling you'll be needing it.
It's so nice to have a new version!
I really can't tell the difference.
Who was that man?
He could see them.
