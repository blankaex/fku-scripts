This one too?
It's become so cloudy in just one night.{"Murky" probably fits better, if accurate}
Strange enough to make even an experienced medium wince.

{2}
gurgle
It clouded up the second I set it down.
Probably best to not stay on this mountain too long.
I thought I might be able to reach the shrine this time,{lit: as I am now}
but I guess it's not that simple.
I hope these girls are safe.

This brings me back!
I really love the McSteaks they do here!{there's a joke about the steak not being a benny's item}
You see this corn I've got as a side?
You can actually get them to swap it for a steak!
I can't get enough of this meat!{tlc}
Though it'd be pretty tough at my age...{Huh? Is she talking about having old people teeth?}

{5}
Is that half-size gratin enough for you, Miko?
Want some corn?
Oh, uh, I'm good thanks.
Kids these days sure don't eat much.
Umm...
Thanks for rescuing me back there.
I don't know what would've happened if you hadn't—
It's Mitsue.
The name's Takeda Mitsue.
They also call me the Godmother of Downtown.
But you can call me whatever you like.

{6}
Oh, okay. Miss Takeda—
Just Mitsue is fine.
...{Intentionally skipped?}
Uh, Mitsue...
Can you see—
Hey, let's mix some coffee into his coke!
Holy shit lol
Do it, I'll post it on TikTok{memesubs}
...
I doubt she's ever spoken to anyone about it.

{7}
She tried to hide it from her friend back then too.
Huh? What are you guys talking about?!
Nothing.
Well, I don't blame her.
This piece of broccoli is you, Miko.
And this piece of carrot is me.
See this corn?
These are the "mosquitoes".

{8}
Do you see them?

{9}
"Mosquitoes" have always gathered around this area since way back when.
Don't worry, they won't "bite" or anything.
...
They'll be on their way soon enough.
Anyway, I wanted to ask how well you can "see".
Are they just hazy outlines to you? Or maybe a bit more—
roll

{10}
Right, I see.{gotcha.}

{11}
I don't see that mosquito, Miko.{no quotes on this one}
{mask}
Did it follow us down from the mountain?
N-No...
It was already here...
...
Oh, so that's what it was.
She wasn't trying to stop the "people" from overhearing.
It left?

{12}
Just my intuition speaking, but I don't think it will hurt you.
Probably.
It doesn't look like the other mosquitoes are up to anything funny.
Your intuition gets rather sharp once you've been in the business as long as I have.
Umm... So...
What should I do?

{13}
This photo...
This is a picture of you and your friend, isn't it?
Yeah, it is. Why do you have it?
Glossing over the details a bit, that shrine caught my attention.
That shrine isn't of this world.
A human should never have been able to set foot inside.
Huh? But I just followed the directions on my phone...
As if it was just that.
You managed to wander inside because all of the conditions had coincidentally been met.
Don't ever try to go back there again.

{14}
Understood?
Oh no.
It's back.

{15}
May I take your plates?
I'll clean up this napkin too.
Oh,
thank you.
Oh no, the corn!
There are places an amateur should never enter.
Do you see where I'm going with this?
What do I do? I need to tell her that it's back...
Sorry for
the wait.

{16}
Anyway, don't go back to that mountain—

{18}
Hm? What's the matter?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I see it all the time.
They all get in line at a certain time and disappear.
Maybe there's a stairway to heaven. Not that I'd know.

{19}
There are a few places where it happens.
There's the alleyway by the MD's near the station.
Where else...
...
Sorry for
the wait.
I can't help but stop and think.
You know, when I see them all disappearing like that.

{20}


{21}
Oh my god.
This way, sir.

{23}
She must be seeing something terrifying.
Miko.
It's fine.
Trust me.
H-How can you be so sure?
You can't even see it.{"it" instead of "them" to be ambiguous, could refer to the suit guy or the spectacle as a whole}

Told you breaking up with him was a good idea!
Yeah, screw him.
Totally!

May I take your order?
Two brown sugar sweet dumpling deluxe parfaits please.
Right away.
Huh? Two?
You don't like sweets?
Consider it a reward for being so brave.

{27}
I can't let this poor girl suffer any longer.
I'll take care of your business with the shrine.
You don't have to worry about a thing.{death flag}
You'll be fine as long as you don't go back there.
I-Is this your intuition again?
It's right most of the time.

{28}
I should be able to buy some time, at least.
Then I'll have to figure out a more permanent solution...
I know it's weird, but I'm actually kind of happy right now.
Oh? How come?
This is the first time I've been able to talk about it with someone.
I haven't said a word about it since I started seeing them.
There wasn't anyone I could confide in.{Poor Julia}
I bet.

{29}
Well, I can't see quite as well as you can.
Though I'd hazard a guess that I'm a tad more experienced.
Just stop by my store if you ever need anything.
Huh? I thought you closed down.
Closed down?
That store is my lifework.
Sorry for the wait. Here's your dessert.
Oh, that looks delicious!
It's huge!
I really don't think you should take that many.
Huh? How come?

{30}
The waiter said it was fine.
He was just being polite!
Anyway hurry up and finish eating so we can get back to looking for{ Miko}—
Miko!
She's right there!
What brings you two here?

{31}
We looked everywhere for you! We were so worried!
My calls kept going to voicemail!
...
Sorry, my battery died.
Oh, it's my fault.
Miko was helping me carry some things.
I've got a bad back, you see.
So I decided to buy her lunch as thanks.
Huh? The bracelet lady?
It's Takeda Mitsue.
Miss Takeda?
Bracelet lady?
Just Mitsue is fine.

{32}
Wow, when did you guys get so close?
We just sort of ran into each other.{lit. sort of just happened}
Who is she?
She really does have an incredible aura.
Whoa!
It's a brown sugar sweet dumpling deluxe parfait!
Hey, Hana!
Why are you sitting there?
I'm so hungry! We've been looking for Miko all day!
Go sit on the other side!
Huh? How come?

{33}
That's my seat!
It's fine, no big deal.

I knew you'd be back.
Oh, Shige. It's you.
It just hasn't been the same without you competing with my business.
Competing for what?
You run a damn shoe store.

...
Take care of yourself.
Where did that come from?
A geezer like you will be kicking the bucket in no time.
That little girl was looking for you, by the way. The one you took on as your apprentice.
{julia}
Oh, right. Her.
She's not my apprentice any more.
Wow, are you still around?
I'm busy.

Excuse me.
Do you happen to have a holy bracelet brimming with power?
