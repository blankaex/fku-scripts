Mieruko-chan

Suddenly, before her very eyes...

{2}
Ngh!

{3}
Mmf...
Miko! Are you okay?!
...
Are you hurt, Yotsuya?
Watch it, dumbass!
ah
That—
was close
Can you stand?
Y-Yeah...

{4}
{spoop}

{5}
You really scared me, jumping out onto the road like that!
Sorry.
Did you hit your head?
I'm all right.
Thank you, Michiru.
For pulling me back.
You should go to the hospital.
I'm fine, really.

{6}
You should definitely get it checked out!
What if your skull was shattered?
Come on, Hana...
...
Hello?
My friend was hit by a truck, and her skull has been shattered.
Could you please send an ambulance?
Hey hold up, hold up!
I get it! I'll go to the hospital!
I'll come with you!
Me too.
I'll be fine by myself!
-ya General Hospital

{7}
It's just a little bump.
You'll be fine.
It could have been a lot worse.
Yeah...
...
So uh, was there anything else? Like, I dunno... Maybe with my brain?
Something that might make me see stuff I shouldn't?
Nothing at all?
Pardon?
Are you seeing things?
Oh, n-no... I was just wondering...
What the heck am I saying?
Hmm...
If you're worried, then I'll just ask you a few quick questions.
I-It's okay, really...
It'll only take a minute.
aaahh

{8}
what's the matter
Your scans suggest nothing out of the ordinary.
im feeling much better
Do you ever have trouble focusing?
let's get started
...
how long has it been {since you've had these symptoms}
What?
I see...
Another scan may provide us with more insight.
ow it hurts
Healthy people don't typical express these symptoms.
aaaahh
im fine im fine
These questions will help in assessing your situation.
Damn... I can't hear a thing he's saying.

{9}
I need to brush this off somehow.
give me
Do you often fall ill?
aaahh
aaaahhhhh
hahahaha
Umm... Yeah...
medicine
Ever feel tired or fatigued?
Y-Yeah, that's right...
hahaha
Have trouble sleeping at night?
you can't see?
there's a shadow
Yeah, exactly!
They both must be getting suspicious!
noooooo
Hmm...
next patient please
This might be quite serious.
—can leave for now.
Is it over?
Thank you!

{10}
{lmao}
-ya General Hospital
They're keeping you here?!
Was your skull shattered?
Are you gonna die?

{11}
Uh, no...
It's no big deal.
It is a big deal!
hahaha...
I guess this is what happens if you don't answer the doctor properly.
They said they were keeping you here to run some tests just in case.
Yeah.
If nothing comes up then I can leave right away.
I'll sneak in and take care of you tonight!
So you don't get lonely!
You have school, Kyousuke.
It's really not as bad as it looks.
In fact I don't think they're even keeping me here because of the bump...
That makes no sense!

{12}
This is a tough one to explain...
I'm fine, promise.
I don't want to make them worry.
I heard that you jumped out in front of a truck.
I was so worried.
I'm glad you're okay.

{13}
Mom...
That's right! We were so worried!
Take care of yourself, stupid!
I will...
Sorry.
I guess I've already made them worry.
-ya General Hospital

{14}
Sorry Hana, they said only family members are allowed to visit.
Are you okay?!
They're keeping you there?
Just for some tests. I'm fine.
Mom and Kyousuke already left.
Gosh, you scared me.
Phew.
Michiru was worried about you as well!
O-Oh.
Can you let her know I'm fine?
All right. Take it easy, okay?
I'll bring you some snacks! How many kilos do you need?
Hahaha
I'll be fine.
Kilos, huh...

{15}
buzz buzz
!
Hm? Did it drop out?
Hello?
aaahhh
Hey!
Turn that off!
Oh, sor—
Calls OK!
Wait, I'm allowed to use my phone here...

{16}
turn that off
buzz buzz

{17}
buzz buzz
ahh aaahhh
Sor?
Sor...
Sorbet would be pretty good...
Calls OK!
You want some ice cream? Got it!
Sorry Hana, I gotta go. It's almost dinner time.
I'll call you later!
Wh—
beep
buzz buzz
...
slip
phew...
This makes my head hurt more than the truck did...
It's so hard to tell if they're real or not.

{18}
Hey, can you see them?
!
That guy just now?

{19}
The guy that said to turn your phone off.
You saw him, right?
Huh?
Chiharu!
I told you not to run off on your own!
Mom!
Were you playing hide and seek again?
No!

{20}
I was hiding from the buzzing guy!
So you were playing hide and seek...
The buzzing guy?
Bye bye, girl who sees them.
Huh?
Girl who... sees them?

{21}
—al Hospital
Kinda reminds me of lunch in elementary school.
Who was she?
She could see them clearly.
This is awful!
!

{22}
This restaurant is terrible!
It all tastes awful!
Uh...
Hahaha...
You want some jelly?
Take it!
No thank you...
You didn't finish your carrots again, Mr. Sasaki.
I can't eat this slop!
Come on, don't be picky.
It's awful!

{23}
I'll take your tray, then.
Oh god, something's here.

{24}
How are you feeling, Mr. Sasaki?
Can it!
Do something about this awful food!
Good to see you're doing well.
It was a person...
This is so confusing...
How are you feeling,
Miss Yotsuya?
Oh,
This doctor looks like he's in worse shape than me...
I'm—
Can't you hear me?
Huh?
Don't make me eat this slop!
Michiko!
I like your cooking better!
You don't have to cook anything!

{25}
...
My food's still not here yet...
Huh?
Was that guy just talking to himself this whole time?
...
How are you feeling?

{26}
Good to see you're doing well.
How are you feeling?
Oh...
I'm...
...

{27}
I'm in the mood for some red bean soup.
Not this jelly...
Red bean soup for me too!
...
How are you feeling?
~~~
That... was close...
Why have there been so many? Because we're in a hospital?
sigh
Apple Jelly

{28}
Wow, you're amazing!
You could see that one too!
She scared me...
Chiharu, was it?
Are you staying here too?
Nope!
My dad is, though.
They said he can come home soon.
Did you get punched in the head?
Not exactly...
Can you see them as well, Chiharu?
Yeah, I can.
I could ever since I was little.
Chiharu!
Oh, Mom's calling me!
Hey, you're pretty good at pretending,
but you should watch out.
It comes out at night time...

{29}
Bye!
Huh?
What?
—al Hospital

{30}
God...
I really need to pee...
It comes out at night time...
Hmm...
The ones that jump out at you are pretty scary...
but I dunno if knowing about it in advance is any better...

{31}
urgh
zzz
Oh, it was just him snoring.
Hospitals at night are so freaky...

{32}
Where was the toilet again?

{33}


{34}


{35}
Uh...
Err...
I think the toilet is this way!
Run, Miko!
Sudden acceleration. Can Miko escape?
