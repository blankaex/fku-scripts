Let him be free.

What did she mean by that?

Good morning, Zen!
I brought you some beef stew!

Be free...
creak
Does that mean I should just be honest with myself?
Oh, what's the special occassio—{she's surprised he's opening the door}
Please stop bringing me food.
I don't want it.

I've been meaning to say this for a while, actually.
There's no way I could eat something a stranger cooked for me.
Huh?
What?
Just the thought of it disgusts me.
Would you be able to eat it?
What if they put hair in it or something?
I can't stand the thought of keeping someone's tupperware in my apartment either.
It'll just start to stink after a few days.
It makes me want to throw up.
Wh-What?
Zen—
I've been throwing out everything you've given me, but then the crows started showing up and causing even more problems.
I did feel a little bad about it, but what else was I going to do?

Anyway I appreciate the thought, but let's leave it at that, okay?
Also, I'm moving out.
Goodbye.
Wh-What?
...
...
Is this what it means to be free?
That was refreshing.
I can't believe he'd say something like that!
How did he know?
I thought I did a pretty good job at hiding it...
