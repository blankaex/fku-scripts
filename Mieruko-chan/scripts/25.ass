He's so cute!
Look at his face!
I honestly can't tell the difference.
Mieruko-chan.
Look, this is the old one!
And this is the new one!
See?
They look exactly the same.
Back to your seats please, everyone.
Let's start homeroom.

A suspicious-looking person has been spotted loitering outside school grounds lately.
Make sure to keep an eye out when you go home.
Seriously?
Gross!
Oh gosh, I'm so scared!
Mr. Zen, can you walk me home?
That's all for today's homeroom.
See you all tomorrow.
Wow he totally ignored you.
He still won't notice me...
Don't let it get to you.
Let's go home, Miko!
Sure.
So I thought it was a dumpling, but when I poked it to check, it was actually a rock!
What were you planning to do if it actually was a dumpling?

What's up?
Forget something?
N-No...

I've been hearing those bells a lot lately...

THREE TIMES
Should I visit the shrine again to say thanks?
They've already saved me three times.
Hey Hana, what do you think would be a good offering?
Offering?
Dumplings would be nice!
I didn't mean for you.
Lambda Rabbit
One per customer, please!
Only while stocks last!

I'm gonna go buy one real quick.
Sure.
I'll just be a sec!
Mind if I sit here?

Huh? What?
Why is he staring at me? He's so creepy...
...
He's human, right?
Oh, right!

Hello, there!
Ew!
Excuse me, young lady.
Would you like a stone?
What the heck?
They come in a variety of different shapes.
What's with this guy?
Where are you, Hana?

Which one would you like?
I-I'm good, thanks.
Miko...
Hana!
I was betrayed and tossed aside...
It was terrible! They said they don't know when there'll be more stock!
Calm down!
What's the matter? Something on your mind?
Who's that?
Someone you know?

Hahaha!
He's so creepy...
How did he send this to everyone?
AirDr●p?{Weird circle intentional}
Let's go, Hana. You can buy the rabbit when they come back in stock.
Okay...

Hey! How'd you get that?
Hmm?
Oh.
There were some people lining up, so I joined the line for fun and ended up with it.
What is it?
It looks like it'd make a good voodoo doll.
I-If you don't want it, may I have it?
Wait!
Hana!
I really, really want it!
But of course.
Which stone would you like?
yoink
Huh?
Stone?
I bet Hana would fall for every pyramid scheme out there.

Oh, you don't want the doll?

What are you doing? This is obviously a pyramid scheme!
Get it together!

Give me back my Lambda Rabbit.
Here's $5.
Huh? Uh, okay...
Wait, give it _back_?
You said I could have it!
That was close! Let's get out of here!
Hurry, Miko! MD's is waiting!
Huh? Uh...
Wait,
I still have this.
You can keep it.
I have a feeling you'll be needing it.

Having a new version is so refreshing!
I really can't tell the difference.
Who was that man?
He could see them.
