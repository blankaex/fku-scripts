An upgrade you wouldn't even notice.

Miko, look! There's a new Lambda Rabbit!
Lambda Rabbit
NEW
Limited Availability {lit limited to certain/physical stores}
Special
{Locati}on {or something idk, maybe just leave this out}
He's so cute!
Look at his face!
I honestly can't tell the difference.
Mieruko-chan.
Look, this is the old one!
And this is the new one!
See?
They look exactly the same.
Back to your seats please, everyone.
Let's start homeroom.

A suspicious-looking person has been spotted loitering outside school grounds lately.
Make sure to keep an eye out when you go home.
Seriously?
Gross!
Oh gosh, I'm so scared!
Mr. Zen, can you walk me home?
That's all for today's homeroom.
See you all tomorrow.
Wow he totally ignored you.
He still won't say anything to me...{Isn't this more like, he forgot her in the roll? Or got her name wrong?}
Don't let it get to you.{This feels kinda stiff, but I can't think of what a JK would say}
Let's go home, Miko!
Sure.
So I thought it was a dumpling, but when I poked it to check, it was actually a rock!
What were you planning to do if it actually was a dumpling?

What's up?
Forget something?
N-No...

I've been hearing those bells a lot lately...
jingle
THREE TIMES
Should I visit the shrine again to say thanks?
They've already saved me three times.
Hey Hana, what do you think would be a good offering?
Offering?
Dumplings would be nice!
I didn't mean for you.
Lambda Rabbit
One per customer, please!
Only while stocks last!

I'm gonna go buy one real quick.
Sure.
I'll just be a sec!
Excuse me. {this is like an excuse me for sitting down next to you, not excuse me can I talk to you}{"Pardon me"?}

Huh? What?
Why is he staring at me? He's so creepy...
...
He's human, right?
Oh, right!

Hello, there!
Ew!
Excuse me, young lady.
Would you like a stone?
What the heck? That's so creepy!{Too wordy? Feels like "So creepy!" would suffice}
They come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
What's with this guy?
Where are you, Hana?

Which one would you like?
I-I'm good, thanks.
Miko...
Hana!
I was betrayed and tossed aside...
It was terrible! They said they don't know when there'll be more stock!
Calm down!
What's the matter? Something on your mind?
Who's that?
Someone you know?

Shindou Rom...
Oh!
That's me!
Hahaha!
He's so creepy...
How did he send this to everyone?
AirDrop?{Do we censor this in ours too?}
Let's go, Hana. You can buy the rabbit when they come back in stock.
Okay...

Hey! How'd you get that?
Hmm?
Oh.
There were some people lining up, so I joined the line for fun and ended up with it.
What is it?
It looks like it'd make a good voodoo doll.
I-If you don't want it, may I have it?
Wait!
Hana!
I really, really want it!
But of course.
Which stone would you like?
swipe
Huh?
Stone?
I bet Hana would fall for every pyramid scheme out there.

Huh? But my Lambda Rabbit...
I'll buy you ten donuts!
Oh, you don't want the doll?
Sorry, we're in a hurry.

What are you doing? This is obviously a pyramid scheme!{w}
Get it together!

Give me back the Lambda Rabbit.
Here's $5.
Huh? Uh, okay...
Wait, give it _back_?
You said I could have it!
That was close! Let's get out of here!
Hurry, Miko! MD's is waiting!
Huh? Uh...
Wait,
I still have this.
You can keep it.
I have a feeling you'll be needing it.

It's so nice to have a new version!
I really can't tell the difference.
Who was that man?
He could see them.
