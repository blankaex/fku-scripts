Ow!
Hey!
Mieruko-chan
No—
Ouch!
Not there...
Ow!
Hi, Mr. Seto!
Aw, the sparrow's back!
A day in the life of Mr. Seto.

{2}
Haha
cheep
chirp

Silly thing.
He's taken such a liking to you!
How cute!
Has he really?
chomp
Ow!
Ever since I treated his injury,
he's been using my office like a restaurant.
chirp

What am I to do?

{3}
You don't seem that upset about it {given you got the birdseed ready}.
You got me there.
How are you doing lately, Maki?
Amazing!
Oh?
You were saying your shoulders were feeling quite heavy.
Is that not bothering you anymore?
Oh yeah!
I started walking to the next station just like you said,
and it's like the weight was never even there!
Good to hear.
Maybe I just wasn't getting enough exercise.
So,
you're not using the other station anymore?

{4}
Oh,
I was thinking of going back to it now that I'm doing better.
Hmm...
Maybe you should keep up the walking a bit longer.
Consistency is key, as they say.
I've also heard some rumors.
Apparently some weirdos have been spotted around the station.
Scary stuff.
What?
Maybe I'll walk after all...
Good idea.
Can I take a photo?!
What are you going to do with the photo?

{5}
Hi, Mr. Seto.
Huh? Is that a sparrow?
Hello, Hayashida.
Don't worry about it.
Oh right! I found the key that I lost!
I looked under the passenger seat one last time,
and you were right on the money!
Many such cases.{Hmm, huh?}
You really saved my butt!
The boss man can get pretty scary...

{6}
Hayashida,
do you know what the weather's like today?
The weather?
Just a moment.
Huh?
I'm out of battery...
Sorry, I'll have to get back to you on the weather—
Ah, don't worry about it.
You should charge that. Don't want to miss an important call.
Good point!
I'm gonna go plug this in!

{7}
Huh?
Where is it?
Did you really finish it?
Yes, I did!
I swear I had it!
clack
Nozaki?
Ah!
Yes?

{8}
Were you looking for this, by any chance?
I found it by the photocopier.
Oh!
Thank goodness!
I thought I'd lost it!
Thank you so much, Mr. Seto.
No problem.
Have a good day.
Thanks, you too!
You can always count on Mr. Seto, huh?
For sure.
Swear I checked by the copier too...
Also,
was that a sparrow on his shoulder?
Sure was.

Hey, Mom.
What's up?
Sorry, my phone was flat.{battery was flat?}
I just started charging—
...
Huh?

{10}
Hayashida!
Enough of this!
Please, boss!
I have to go!
What's wrong, Hayashida?
I just got a call from my Mom.
Apparently our dog is on its last legs...
Oh no, poor thing.
What's more important to you, your dog or your job?
M—My d—
I say he should go.
Mr. Seto!

{11}
We should help each other out when we're in trouble.
Someone can cover for him today.
But,
family can't be replaced.
Mr. Seto!
Wow...
Mr. Seto!
...
Well, if you say so, Mr. Seto.

{12}
Thank you, boss!
Good stuff, bossman!
Get going, Hayashida!
We'll take care of things here!
Thank you so much, Mr. Seto.
I grew up with that dog. He's like a brother...
I don't—
Go on now.
Tarou's waiting for you.
Tarou, I'm coming!
Huh? Wait a second...
Did I ever tell Mr. Seto about Tarou?

{13}
You can always count on him.
Mr. Seto, from Section 2.
There was a sparrow on his shoulder.
♪〜
See you later.
And in last week's meeting—

{14}


{15}
Whoa!{F}
!

{16}
Hello, there.
It's been a while.

{17}
How have you been,
little Romm?
H-Hello.
Long time no see,
Mr. Seto.

{18}
Chirp
My arm isn't a branch...
cough
cough
...
You're keeping a sparrow?
That's a violation of the Wildlife Protection Law.{https://www.env.go.jp/nature/choju/law/law1-1.html}{Nice lawyering}
An unlawful trespasser has no business lecturing me.
Also I'm not keeping it.

{19}
This wasn't where we agreed to meet, little Romm.
Why are you here?
Er...
Well, I went to the designated spot,
but it was a dilapidated warehouse in the middle of nowhere.
I was a little frightened.
I figured coming to your office in the middle of the day would be safer... For me...
Dear me.
Are you seriously under the impression I would do something to you?
Yes.
Hahahaha!

{20}
Come now, Romm...
You wound me.

{21}
grasp
You're the one who called me, right?
mmff nggff mmmph
You wanted me to help you out of a pickle?
Sorry to hear that.
Right, right.
We should help each other out when we're in trouble.
Very well.
I'll help you out, Romm.
I just happen to be in a bit of a bind myself.

{22}
The Confinement Zone.
It's been breached.
Welp.
Figured he'd know.
I'm talking about the shrine on that mountain.
...

{23}
Any idea what might've happened?
chirp

{24}
Oh,
Mr. Seto!
Hello, Maki.
We meet again.
Check this out!
I set that photo as my wallpaper!
Oh?
Dear me.
Oh, goodbye!
Yep!
See you next time!
?

{25}
Phew.
Station, west exit.
11PM. Got it?

{26}
Geez.
He's even got a tail on me.
What a frightening fellow.

Hello.

Who are you?
I'm Romm.
Romm?
That's right. Romm.
What's your name?
...
Aoi.
Hello, Aoi.
What about him?
Chuuta.

{30}
Chuuta hurt his leg and can't walk.
Oh dear.
We'd better treat him.
Mama will fix him.
Where's Mama?
...
It's dangerous to stay here.
A scary man will show up.
Let's go look for your mom.

{31}
How old are you, Aoi?
I don't know.
What about you?
I'm not sure either.
Weirdo.
Haha.
Me? Weird?
You're a grown-up but you don't know?
Even grown-ups have things they don't know.
Where's Mama?
I want to be with Mama!

I'll get this sorted.

{35}
...
Ah.
Scary man!
No!
Mr. Seto!
I see.
So it's taken the form of a child.

{36}
How pitiful.

{37}
Taking the form of a child. Truly pitiful.
Mamaaaaa!
aaaaaaaah
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH

She was just a—

{38}
A rat has been causing some trouble for one of my colleagues lately.
I know it's lurking around this station somewhere,
but trying to figure out which rat is gnawing at your cheese
isn't so easy.
Investigation is a lot of work, you know?
So, you know,
I will simply stomp them all out.

{39}
Romm, did you know?
I'm always on the humans' side.
If you're deceived by outward appearances,
it'll come back to bite you in the ass.

{40}
Huh?
Okay.
All right.
I see.
Indeed.
Yes.
...
Well, of course.
Yes.
All right.
Romm.

{41}
Tell me about Yotsuya Miko.
In detail.
{surprised migochu}

{42}
That's my pudding...
Huh?
Why are you eating my pudding?
I-I don't see your name on it!
That wasn't very nice, Kyousuke.
You should apologize to your sister.

Happy Family.
