Countless heads raised,
wearily waiting
for her to cry

I cry
and cry

and cry
and cry
and still I haven't cried enough

Stones might all look the same, but they're all unique.
Some have a bit of a glimmer, shall we say? It's kind of like the stone is trying to tell you something.
I'll teach you how to tell the powerful stones apart from the—
Did you hear that?
Just now.

{3}
Romm.
Listen closely. This is important.
Never ever set foot on that mountain.
I don't care what you hear. Don't do it.
Understood?
All right.

He can see things that I can't.
He can hear things that I can't.
I'm supposed to help him,
but I don't know what to do.
I'm not good enough to be his master.
You've always been like this.
Ever since we met.

I decided I'd do whatever I could to support those children.
Be it running a shady fortune telling store or whatever.
The children that come to us aren't like the rest.
They're all alone with nobody to confide in.
They need help more than anyone.
You've worked so hard for this, but you only ever have the children in mind.
You need to look out for yourself as well.

{8}
You're acting like you're their mother.
Oh, that takes me back!
I mean, sure...
But it still feels weird calling myself "Godmother" in front of him.
You might be right, though.
I might have been taking advantage of you.
That child is extremely talented. He needs someone to guide him.
It was my job to show him the way.
But I just made excuses, like being busy with my TV work.
I can't believe I did this.
It's not you who's not good enough. It's me.
I'm getting mad at myself just thinking about it.

{9}
I'll take care of things.
Just leave him with me.
...
No.
I said I'd look after him.
He's my apprentice now.
He'll definitely go back to the mountain.
He might wander into somewhere even more dangerous next time.
If that happens...

Is this smoke?

{20}
Miko! Are you all right?
I'm fine...
What is this?
...
It's insect repellant.
Brimming with power.
I set up a whole bunch of them earlier.
!
Also it's not very good for you, so try not to breathe too much of it in.
! {lmao her face}
What did you do?

{21}
Mrs. Mitsue, Miko,
I think it would be in your best interests{You should make like trees}
to get out of here while you still can.{and get the hell out of here.}
!
The barrier has been weakened.
Mrs. Mitsue, you should be able to pass through now. {while it's weakened}
Not to worry, Miko.
I won't be charging for this service.
Aren't you glad to hear that?
Huh?
What do you mean?
What are you planning to do?
There's no time. You need to get out of here quickly—

{22}
I'm tired of your shit, Romm.
...

{23}
All those years ago,
this bell was meant for me.
But it was taken from me, so I came to reclaim it.{What even}
That's all I came here for.
Wha—
Thank you for your help.

{24}
If you'll excuse me.
Goodbye.
Go, quickly.

The bells are ringing again!
It made my mind go blank earlier... {:^)}{Miko's thoughts: IA, IA, IA, IA, IA...}
And not in a good way...
Mrs. Mitsue?

... {actually F}

{31}
What are you doing? {oh not ded still}
You need to get Miko out of—
Quiet.

{32}
I'm your master.
And a master would never leave her apprentice behind.
Mrs. Mitsue!
Romm!
!
Romm...
Take Miko and get out of here.
Understood?

{34}
Mitsue?
Yeah?
Remember that chat we had the other day?
Have you had some time to think about it?
Oh, about becoming your apprentice?
Yes, that.
Hmm... I'm not too sure.
Still thinking, huh?
What's troubling you?

{35}
I'm sure you'll be able to help plenty of people in the future.
Trust me.
No, it's not that...
I don't like the name you gave me.
Can I have another one?
I'm not budging on that.
It's perfect for you!
Come on...
You're the apprentice,
"Godmother",
and I'm the master,
"Oka Towako".
