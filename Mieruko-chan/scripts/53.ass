My condolences, Ichijou.
I heard it was a head-on collision.
Michiru is still so little.
Poor thing.
I must
protect Michiru.
Mieruko-chan
A sister's unwavering determination was born on that day.

{2}
As per our previous conversation,
we can't change class enrollments barring exceptional circumstances.
If you have any pressing concerns, you should have a discussion—
All right.
I'm unenrolling her from this school.

{3}
{susge}
Excuse me?{r u srs}
I'll be back another day to do the paperwork.
Let's go home, Michiru.
This isn't where you belong.
Huh?
Her location is off.
Yeah.
Thanks, Julia.
I'll keep looking for a little longer.

{4}
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please—
H-Hello...
Yotsuya!
Why are you still at school?
If you're done for the day then you should head home.
Oh, umm...
Hana disappeared all of a sudden.
Have you seen her, Sir?
No...
I can't get in touch with her either.
I'm a little worried.

{5}
Hana?
Is this her?
Huh?
I recognize this photo...
Why do you—

{6}
Ichijou Michiru. Yurikawa Hana.
Please report to the staff room immediately.

{7}
Huh? Are we getting called to the staff room?
I didn't hear anything.
Hey, we have no reception in here.
I hope Miko's not worried about me.
Why should Miko
need to spend her time worrying about you?
heheh
Miko's a bit of a worrywart.
Yurikawa.

{8}
Tell me.
What's your relationship with Miko?
Huh?
Huh?

{9}
I want to get closer to Miko.
Much, much,
much closer.
I thought you looked really pretty,{ch47p26}
Michiru...{ch47p26}
I know Miko feels the same way.
So...

{10-11}
I'd like you to stay out of our way.

{12}
Kohane!
Here you go.
Remember?
You said your hat got blown away.
I found it the sewer.
Here.

{13}
What?
That's gross.
I don't want it.
Michiru, storm drains are dangerous.
Stay away from them, okay?
Kohane was crying because she lost her hat.
So I looked real hard for it.

{14}
Right.
You're a good girl, Michiru.
Come on, You,
give me a break!
Michiru snuck into Akari's bed again!
Sorry.
I hate you, Michiru!

{15}
Akari said she was scared to sleep alone.
That's why I went to visit her.
You're so kind, Michiru.
You're so mean, Michiru!
Don't you feel sorry for Rena?
Yeah, what's wrong with you?
We're not playing with you anymore!
Regarding Michiru's behavior,
I think it's just Michiru's own way of communicating with her friends,{autism is a terrible disability}
but... How do I put it? It's a bit excessive at times.
Perhaps you could help with her discipline at home, too?

{16}
Why?
Why can't I play too?
Because I don't want you to be sad.
I'll stay with you, okay?

{17}
There was a bird.
It tried to eat him.
Can he be my friend?
Michiru...
Let's go home...

{18}
Student Radio Room.
Michiru is a bit of a strange child.
She doesn't do a very good job of interacting with others.
It's hurt her a number of times in the past.
So I figured if she had no friends in the first place,
there wouldn't be anyone to hurt her.{galaxy brain}

{19}
So I would separate her from others before they could become friends,
before she could get too close to anyone,
before they could leave her and hurt her.
{Mask right}{ch46p28}
Unsanctioned photos of my sister aren't allowed.{ch46p28}
I'm a terrible sister, aren't I?
But that's how I've been protecting her this whole time.
Michiru only has one friend.
It's a caterpillar she's been keeping.
A caterpillar can't hurt her.
Until...

{20}
Every time her caterpillar spun its cocoon, I would swap it out.{Called it}
I'll find him!
Pii!
Pii's gone!
But one time, I forgot. And that's when things started going downhill.
Once Michiru started middle school,
she'd unfortunately made some friends.
It did not go well.

{21}
I think Hana
is with Michiru.
Look at the photo.
You can probably tell what she's thinking.
We need to find them quickly.
There's no telling what Michiru might do...

{22}
From now on,
stay away from Miko.

{23}
Michiru? What's the matter?
It should be me!
I care much, much more about Miko!

Is that how you felt?
I said it's quite likely—
Well,
then Hana

{28-29}
will be fine.{POWER OF FRINDSHIP}{Is this how I get girls to hug me}

{30}
Thank you, Michiru!
Thanks for caring so much about Miko!
Huh?

{31}
She'll be fine?
What are you talking about?
Were you even listening to me? Michiru's—
I was.
But Michiru
won't do anything to Hana.

{32}
Michiru's a pretty open book.
I can tell when she's happy, or having fun, or upset.
munch{ch50.2p10}
It shows on her tent—uh, in her body language.
She's tried to intimidate Hana a bunch of times,
but she's never tried to hurt her.
And then...
And then there's Hana.

{33}
Y'know, Miko's been kind of down lately.
I can tell. There's something on her mind.
But she won't tell me what it is.
So I don't feel like I should ask about it.
When her dad passed away,
she put on a brave face,
so that I wouldn't worry about her.
Even though I knew how sad she must've been.

{34}
That's why I always put on a brave face too.
That's all I can do for her.
Could you hear her out?
sniff
I don't know what's troubling her,
but if you're on the case,
I know she'll be fine.

{35}
{imagine breaker sounds}
revenge!
revenge!
Huh...

All of a sudden...
I'm getting really hungry...

Cream Melon Bun
mmf
A bun?
Huh?

{37}
She wasn't in the cafeteria either.
I'd better message Miko.
Aaahhh!
Nooooo!
Lil' boomers?
Wait...
That's the gym storage room!
Why?

{38-39}
{owned by bread}

{40}
Huh?
Chocolate Melon Bun
Hana's pastry party.
A doughy care package in the scorched battlefield of the storeroom.
