Mieruko-chan
Did you see her?
Yeah.
I hope you got to say your farewells.
We couldn't exactly sit back and reminisce about old times.
It was all over in a flash.
It's a long story.
Staying true to herself, no matter what she became.

{2}
Romm and I searched for years and never found her.
She was more concerned with helping people than saying goodbye to her apprentice.
Can't believe her...
How admirable.
Damn right.
That's why I became her apprentice.
Are we still harboring ill will against Romm?
A lot has happened between us these past few decades.
I guess I've let him start calling himself my apprentice
You're so stubborn.

{3}
Why don't you go make up with your apprentice too?
...
Maybe if he comes to apologize.
You don't even remember what you're upset about.
Stubborn.
Has he been doing all right?
Yeah, he's been putting that hoe to work.{meme but good}
Maybe if we get back together, I'll find the time to make up with him.
Dream on, geezer.
But you're going back to the countryside, right?
No.
There might come a time
when this withered hag is needed again.

{4}
Good morning, class.
Let me introduce you all.
This is the new transfer student.
Her name is...{lmao}

{5}
I'm Ichijou Michiru.{üëÅüëÅ}
It's a pleasure to meet you all.
Hello!
She's so hot!
Hey Michiru!
Learn the transfer student's name at least!
I wonder which school's uniform that is.
...
Oh, she's joining our class!

{6}
Have a seat.
I guess I'm the only one who can see a monster,
and everyone else sees her as a person?
When I bumped into her earlier,
it did feel like bumping into a person.
What am I supposed to do?

{7}
Hello.
Miko Vision
Uh.
Hey.
You're being kinda rude, Miko. What's wrong?
Ugh...

{8}
I guess I should just treat her like a normal person?
Hey,
sorry for bumping into you earlier...
I'm... Yotsuya Miko...
Eye contact, eye contact.
Where the heck are her eyes?

{9}
I'm Yurikawa Hana! Just call me Hana!
Nice to meet you, Michiru!
Hello.
Nice to meet you, Yotsuya. Yurikawa.
I'm telling you, it's her!
Look!
OMG!
It's Chiruru!
She's Chaos Teen's in-house model!
1: Pinnacle of Cuteness
2: Go for the heart
3: Model:

6: Spiky rose thing Ôø•2000 {actually says this}
7: Can't hold a candle to her
8: Attention
9: Butterfly Boots {idk}

{10}
Whoa, you're a model?
That's so cool!
I feel like I've seen you before!
You're so slim!
Your hair is so pretty too!
Is it okay if I touch it?{Girls are weird. Do we need to consult a girl on if this is how they'd say it?}
No!
You shouldn't just... do that... all of a sudden...

{11}
{üëÅüëÅ}
What's wrong, Miko?
Uh...
I mean... it's her first day...
M-Miko's right! She's not here for show!
Buzz off, everyone!
Didn't you start this, Chie?
School's part of her private life, right?
She probably just wants normal friends.
Plain ol' regular friends.
Are you hoping for a referral to her agency or something?
{mask}
I'm not!
It's so obvious...
All right, back to your seats everyone.
It's time for class.
Your hair is so pretty too!

{12}
Is it okay if I touch it?
Was that because she tried to touch her hair?
This girl might be bad news...

{13}
Lunch time!
Let's clean out the cafeteria!
Oh, Michiru! Wanna grab lunch with us?
!
Hey, Chiruru!
Wanna eat with us?
What do you usually eat? Are you on a diet?

{14}
Sorry,
Yotsuya already asked.
Aww!
For real, Miko?
Maybe next time.
I didn't invite you!
Please, lead the way.
The pastries at the cafeteria are the best!

{15}
Cafeteria
Demon Bun
Fried Cream & Sugar Roll
Choc-chip Curry Danish
Whoa, there's so many new ones!
So innovative!
What do I do? Should I just get them all?!
I feel like it'd be better to stay away from her,
but getting on her bad side probably isn't a good idea either.
How about one of these, Michiru?
I love these!

{16}
This one especially!
It's so good!
What?!
Wh-Why is it going after Hana too?
!
Caterpillar Croissant

{17}
This one's not too bad either!
And this one's also pretty good!
How‚Äî
rustle
How about this one?
Caterpillar
Come on, Miko, that's not enough for‚Äî
{mask}
It's so cute...

{18}
Thank you, Yotsuya.
I'll get this.
N-No problem.
I guess size _doesn't_ matter.
Excuse me! Could I get two of each of these, please?
And this one, and this one‚Äî
Phew, it's back to normal...
I can't see her face but I can kind of tell what she's thinking by her, uh, tentacles?
I'll have to be careful to not get her worked up.
I don't know what it might do.
Hey Julia!
You didn't bring your own lunch today?
I thought I might come to the cafeteria once in a‚Äî

{19}
She's so long...
Oh, let me introduce you. This is Ichijou Michiru!
She just joined our class today.
Oh, the transfer student everyone's talking about.
Uh, hello. I'm Niguredou Julia.
Nice to meet you, Niguredou.
I guess she doesn't look like a monster to Julia.
Hmm...
And it doesn't seem to be affecting Hana, either.

{20}
burn it with fire
...
hey kijima
let's go
gulp

{21}
I forgot they were still around too.
let's go
Hmm... I think there's something next to Miko.
I've been watching lots of Romm's videos lately.
Enigma!

{24}
By the way, Michiru.
Is that croissant all you're going to eat?
...
I'm a light eater.
Oh, I guess you are a model.
Watching your diet must be tough.
{mask}
She exorcised it just by looking at it?!{god this stupid autist}
glare

{25}
I need to go see Mrs. Mitsue or Romm.
Maybe after school.

{26}
Yep
All right
clack clack
Hahaha

There we go, that's the last of them.
It's a breeze, you just need to rile them up a little.
Hello, thanks for the superchat!

Hello? Shindou Romm speaking.
...
Yes,
I'm fine now.
...
Right.
Okay.

{28}
This sounds like work.
Please, I'd love to hear the details.
Investigating the area would be a good place to start.

Hmm? A bell?
Oh, that's just the cat.
It sometimes stops by.
Hahaha

{29}
Hahaha, no need for concern.
Danger is my middle name!

{30}
Mrs. Mitsue wasn't home,
and I don't know Romm's number.
I guess I'll have to try another day.
Oh, Chaos Teen.
Hmm...

Home time.

{32}
I had a great day today, Pii.
Do you want to hear about it?
I made a new friend!
Her name is Yotsuya Miko.
We get along really well.
She showed me a croissant that looked just like you!

{33}
She had a Meme keychain too.
Lolol
I was surprised to learn she likes Lolol too. We have so much in common!
And when someone tried to touch my hair,
she yelled at them to stop.
It was almost as if she knew I don't like being touched.
When I met her this morning,
she looked me right in the eye,
and dove straight into my arms.
I thought she was one of my fans at first, but I was wrong.
She's so mysterious. Nobody looks at me the way she does.
It was like she could see right through me,
but she wasn't even looking at me.

{34}
I've never felt like this before...
