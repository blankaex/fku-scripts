Sure thing!
Here you go!
Oh!
Hey Baldzuka!
Hi Hana.
It's Gouzuka.
Patisserie Grizzly
Are you working here?
Just for a few weeks.
Wha—do you know him?
He's a regular...
Yeah, I gave him a cat before.
We follow each other on Z now.
Thank you for always liking my cat pictures.

{4}
Oh!
Mr. Gouzuka!
Hi.
Hello.
How's Meowel doing?
He's eating pretty well.
Cake?
No, cat food.
Forest bear snowman cake
We sell cakes that cats can eat too!
I know.
I'm a regular.
Thanks for stopping by!
See you later!
Enjoy your shift.

{5}
Dad, I want a cake!
All right, you win.
That scared me.
What's up?
O-Oh, nothing!
An unassuming middle-aged man?
Is that how he looks to you?

{6}
Huh?
Do you see something else?
Could you put the photo away first, please?
I'll die.
Oh, sorry.
Do you remember in the hospital,
when I told you about the different ways of seeing?
Yeah?
People might also see things in an entirely different form.
There are a number of reasons why this might be.

{7}
This one is particularly bad news.
We'd best take care of it quickly.
Take care of it?
Burn the photo or throw it away.
If it ever appears before you,
make sure you ignore it like you've always been doing.
Just go about life as you normally would.
Leave this with me.
I'll ask around and see what I can dig up.

{8}
Live life as usual, huh?
I guess that's all I really can do.

These are the cats that were following Mr. Gouzuka around.
There's something under here.

Oh.

Sorry Hana!
I gotta return something real quick!
Huh?
Hey, wait!

{10}
Th-They're so quick...
Huh? It's a dead end...
Oh...
Uhh... The wall?
Pretty whimsical, huh?
I suppose they are cats.
Guess I'll go around.

I got some for you too—

{12}
Meow
Wow.
He's grown a lot.
Argh, I wanna give him a hug but I can't.
Yeah, don't wanna be messing around on the clock.
So, what did you say that I dropped?
Did you follow me all the way back here?
Oh, right.
I'm not sure if it's actually yours,
?

{13}
but it looked important.

{14}
Oh, I must've dropped this in the store.
I didn't think I'd ever find it again.
My wife gave it to me.
She was frail,
and forever hospitalized.
But always had a smile on her face.
Hello.
She was always more worried about me than herself.
This was something she made for me.
She said it would bring me happiness.

{15}
But...
I wasn't able to make her happy.
You know,
she's still smiling right now.
Huh?

{16}
Oh, uh, I just meant...
She probably would be... If she were here right now... Yeah...
Right.
...
Hm.
You're starting to act like a real Santa Claus.
You've brought me such a wonderful present.
Thank you.

{17}
Me, Santa?
I wonder if he'd pay me a visit too.
What kind of present would I want?
Maybe a pair of glasses that would stop me from seeing.

Miko?
What were you up to?
I was worried because you were taking so long to get back!
baaa {lmfao}
Were you able to give back the thing you found?

{22}
{saj migo}
It's Santa...

Huh?
I'm a reindeer!
You're the Santa!
Hey look, it's snowing!
You're right.
rumble
Gosh, I'm famished!
Hey, after work let's call up Michiru and Julia and...
Merry Christmas.

{23}
Snow...
It's snowing.
Look.
They said it'd be a warmer winter this year.
You think this is a one-off?
Hm.
Yes.
Yes.
You're right.

{24}
Oh, I see.
Yes.
Yeah, you're right.
Wow.
Looks like it's broken.
Sigh.

{25}
Well, well.
You've gone and done it now, Rommy boy.
Literally who?{same}
Sigh.
Seto
I really don't wanna call him.
