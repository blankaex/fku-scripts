I didn't think so many people would be into Lambda Rabbit.

Or so Hana says.
How are you doing, by the way?
I heard Hana took you out for food.
I was mostly just watching her eat.{LOOOOOL}
...
I wish I could eat as much as Hana could...
Then I would have more power.
You'd need some special training for that...
Miko!
Look!

{4}
They have impaled rabbit heads!
How horrific!
No better way to say that?
They're candied apples...
Ah... Better not look at that one.
...
Let's check out this side!
But the stakes...

{5}
Maybe I'll get this one.
I think Hana would like it.
Excuse me—
Huh?
Ain't that Nigredo?
I knew it was you!
Long time no see! Remember me?

Phew, had me worried!
I thought you'd forgotten about me!
Your leg...
Oh, this?
I fell down the stairs
It's not a terrible injury
But I feel like I've been hurting this leg a lot lately
Crazy right

{8}
Didn't you say...
You could see ghosts?
...
slip
Why do you ask?
Oh, y'know...
Just came to mind...
So, d'ya still—
No way.
Huh?

{9}
There's no way I can see ghosts.
I was lying.
I just wanted to stand out.
Hey, uhh...
Sorry,
I'm keeping my friends waiting.
Oh...

{10}
All good?
Did you know her?
Not really...

She might overeat again!

Oh, sorry! Coming!

{more flashback lines}
{whatever I wrote before}

{16}
I'm just a half-assed medium...
Nigredo?

{17}
Wha—
Why are you here?
Huh?
I just finished work early...
What are you up to, anyway?
Huh?
You crying?
...
N-No...
Anyway, I'm busy.
Later!
Hey!
Why are you following me?
Because you're running away!
I'm not...

{18}
And this is a dead end, anyway...
!
...
See?
...
Nigredo...
Do you...{hate me? I guess?}

{19}
Whoa!
Ah!
Do you have fun scaring people?{is this a real flashback?}
What's up with that pick me attitude?
You're such a freak!

{20}
!
...
Th—
Thanks...
Ow...
Not my leg again...
Think I grazed it...
...
It's cursed.
Huh?

{21}
Your leg.
I see something.
Looks cursed.
Like, a ghost?
Huh? Uhh...
Like a hand?
It's kind of hazy...
Looks like it's kind of grabbing you.

{22}
Gross...{btfod}
So it is a ghost!
Gross!
!
I knew I shouldn't have gone to that haunted place!
I keep hurting this leg!
God, this sucks, wtf??
You believe me?
Huh?
You can see it, right?
I mean, yeah...
...

{23}
I don't have any... spiritual powers?
And none of my friends believe in that stuff.
But I kept getting injured
and I remembered about you.
Back when we were in grade school,
you made a fuss about a ghost in the back of the class and made a bunch of kids cry
stop it!
it's true!
Some people got mad because you were so pushy aobu it
I called you a freak
and said some other pretty mean things
but having nobody believe you
is pretty rough, huh?

{24}
but
you were kinda freaky
huh?
I mean, does it really matter if it's true or not?
You were making people upset at the end of the day.
...
hana gets scared easily{god is this another flashback}
I guess... you're right...
...
Here!

{25}
as thanks for telling me!
you wanted one, right?
Oh...
Thanks...
No problem, they gave me a bunch.
Do you mind if I try something?
Not sure if it'll work...
Try what?

{26}
Exorcism...
Hello? Hana? Did you find Jula?
No, there's no sign of her...
And she's not picking up...

{27}
Where's Michiru?
I asked her to wait by the tree in case Julia comes back.
She'll stick out like a sore thumb...
It's better if she does...
True... All right, I'll keep looking a little—
Oh!
What happened? Did you find her?
Not yet... But let me just check to be sure...
I'll call you back.
...
~~
Is that Julia's voice?

{28}
Spider!{tfw brainlet mushroom}
Is it gone?
Uh... No...
Not yet...
This is pretty cool, is that how exorcisms work these days?
Some kind of spell?
Not quite...

{29}
I knew I wasn't good enough...
...
ruffle

I still have Romm's power stone...
Power stones are like a demon repellent{another offscreen flashback?}
so they can drive off your low-levelled riff-raff.
If the stone stars to shake,
then you'll know it's working.

{30}
However
if it starts to crack and fissure,
then you should take it as a warning sign.
Miko..?
What you're dealing with can't be handled by an amateur,

{31}
and you should run away as fast as you can.
Julia!

Huh?
But I didn't do anything...
Thank you!

Y—
Yeah...

{38}
Julia!
Iwas so worried!
I thought you'd been kidnapped!
S-Sorry...
can't breathe...{classic}
I'm glad we found her.{wtf lol}
Uh,
Yeah...
But what was that thing after all?
{mask}
See you later, Nigredo!
I'm gonna head off!
Oh.

{39}
...
Bye!
Who's that?
A friend?
...
Acquaintance...

{40}
Sorry, Hana.
You missed out on buying the light-up rabbit because of me.
Don't sweat it!
That was nothing!
I'm just happy that you're here.
Sorry for troubling you too, Miko.
That was your doing earlier, right?
Huh?
You know... The exorcism...
Uh, no...
I got ahead of myself...
I thought I could take care of it myself.
But with half-assed resolve and half-assed powers
I just end up hurting myself and those around me.
I'm still not good enough.

{41}
...
Don't get up to any more dangerous antics on your own, okay?
Not that I exorcised anything...
But if it keeps her out of trouble,
then let's go with that...
Okay...
Hey!
Just a sec!
?
Lambda rabbit power!
Thank you, gods of the park!{oh no it was her all along}
You helped bring Julia back to us!

{42}
Hana?
Sorry for the wait!
What should we eat next?
You still wanna eat?
The festival's not over yet!
