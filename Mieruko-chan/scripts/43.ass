Are you hurt, Yotsuya?
Watch it, dumbass!

Can you stand?
Y-Yeah...

{spoop}

{5}
You scared me when you just jumped out onto the road!
Sorry.
Did you hurt your head?
I'm all right.
Thanks Michiru.
For pulling me back.
You should go to the hospital.
I'm fine, really.

{6}
You should definitely get it checked out!
What if your skull was pulverized?
Come on, Hana...
...
Hello?
My friend was hit by a truck, and her skull has been pulverized.
Could you please send an ambulance?
Hey hold up, hold up!
I get it, I'll go to the hospital!
I'll come with you!
Me too.
I'll be fine by myself!

It's just a little bump.
You'll be fine.
Good thing you didn't get run over, huh?
Yeah...
...
Is that all? Was there anything else? Like, I dunno... Maybe with my brain?
Something that might make me see stuff I shouldnt?
Nothing at all?
Huh?
Are you seeing things?
Oh, n-no... I was just wondering...
What the heck am I saying?
Hmm...
If you're worried then I'll just ask you a few quick questions.
I-It's okay, really...
It'll only take a minute.

-ya General Hospital
They're keeping you here?!
Did your skull get pulverized?
Are you gonna die?

{11}
Uh, no...
It's no big deal.
It is a big deal!
hahaha...
I guess this is what happens if you don't answer the doctor properly.
They said they were keeping you here to run some tests just in case.
Yeah.
If nothing comes up then I can leave right away.
I'll sneak in and take care of you tonight!
So you don't get lonely!
You have school, Kyousuke.
It's really not as bad as it looks.
In fact I don't think they're even keeping me here because of the bump...
That makes no sense!

{12}
This is a tough one to explain...
I'm fine, promise.
I don't want to make them worry.
I heard that you jumped out in front of a truck.
I was so worried.
I'm glad you're okay.

{13}
Mom...
That's right! We were so worried!
Take care of yourself, stupid!
I will...
Sorry.
I guess I've already made them worry.
-ya General Hospital

{14}
Sorry Hana, they said only family members are allowed to visit.
Are you okay?!
They're keeping you there?
Just for some tests. I'm fine.
My mom and brother already left.
Gosh, you scared me.
Phew.
Michiru was worried about you as well!
O-Oh.
Can you let her know I'm fine?
All right. Take it easy, okay?
I'll bring you some snacks! How many kilos do you need?
Hahaha
I'll be fine.
What do you mean kilos lol

{15}
buzz buzz
!
Hm? Did it drop out?
Hello?
aaahhh
Hey,
Turn that off!
Oh, sor—
Calls OK!
Hang on, I'm allowed to use my phone here...

{16}

buzz buzz

{17}
buzz buzz
ahh aaahhh
Sor?
Sor...
Sorbet would be pretty good...
You want some ice cream? Got it!
Sorry Hana, I gotta go. It's almost dinner time.
I'll call you later!
Wh—
beep
buzz buzz
...
slip
phew...
This does my head in more than the truck did...
It's so hard to tell if they're real or not.

{18}
Hey, can you see them?
!
That guy just now?

{19}
The guy that said to turn off your phone.
You saw him, right?
Huh?
Chiharu!
I told you not to run off on your own!
Mom!
Were you playing hide and seek again?
No!

{20}
I was hiding from the buzzing guy!
So you were playing hide and seek...
The buzzing guy?
See you later, lil miss can see ghosts.
Huh?
She can see them?

{21}
—al Hospital
Kinda reminds me of the lunch from elementary school.
Who was she?
She could see them perfectly.
This is awful!
!

{22}
This restaurant is terrible!
There's no flavor at all!
Huh?
Hahaha...
You want some jelly?
Take it!
I-I'm good, thanks...
You didn't finish your carrots again, Mr. Sasaki.
I can't eat this slop!
Come on, don't be picky.
It's awful!

{23}
I'll take your tray, then.
Oh god, something's here.

{24}
How are you feeling, Mr. Sasaki?
Can it!
Do something about this awful food!
Good to see you're doing well.
It was a person...
This is so confusing...
How are you feeling,
Miss Yotsuya?
Oh,
This doctor looks like he's in worse shape than me...
I'm fi—
Can't you hear me?
Huh?
Don't make me eat this slop!
Michiko!
I'd much rather eat your cooking!
You don't have to cook anything!

{25}
...
My food's still not here yet...
Huh?
Was that guy just talking to himself this whole time?
...
How are you feeling?

{26}
Good to see you're doing well.
How are you feeling?
Oh...
I'm...
...

{27}
I'm feeling like some red bean soup...
Not jelly...
One red bean soup for me too!
...
How are you feeling?
~~~
That... was close...
Why are there so many? Because we're in the hospital?
sigh

{28}
Wow, you're amazing!
You could see that one too!
She scared me...
Chiharu, was it?
Are you a patient here?
Nope!
My dad is, though.
They said he'll be discharged soon.
Did you get punched in the head?
I didn't quite get punched...
Can you see them as well, Chiharu?
Yeah, I can.
I could ever since I was little.
Chiharu!
Oh, it's mom!
Hey, you seem pretty good at playing things off,
but you should watch out.
Night time in the hospital is bad news.

{29}
Bye!
Huh?
What?
—al Hospital

{30}
God...
I really need to pee...
Night time in the hospital is bad news.
Hmm...
The ones that jump out of nowhere are pretty scary...
but I dunno if knowing about it in advance is any better...

{31}
snore
zzz
Oh, it was just him snoring.
Hospitals at night are freaky...

{32}
Where was the toilet again?

{33}


{34}


{35}
Uh...
Err...
I think the toilet is this way!
Run, Miko!
Abrupt acceleration. Can Miko escape?
