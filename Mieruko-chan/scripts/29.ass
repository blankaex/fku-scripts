This guy here is really neat!
You can control him with your phone.
No need to enter a dilapidated building ever again!
Would you like one?
I have to admit, he is a little noisy though.
I don't want it.
Romm.
Why are you here?
{mask left}

{2}
That's not a very friendly greeting.
You've just been reunited with your beloved apprentice!
I don't have any apprentices.
And all I see you doing is selling shady merchandise.
You sent that photo, didn't you?
What are you up to?
I knew it was too early for you to retire.
You're just as sharp as ever.

{3}
Are you mocking me?
No, not at all.
Not in the slightest.
You have my heartfelt respect.
Aren't we trying to achieve the same goal?

We can help people out while we're at it. Two birds with one stone.

It's no wonder they called you the Godmother of Downt—
Enough.
What do you want?
I don't have time for your empty flattery.
Dear me, I was speaking from the heart.

So, tell me then.
When do you plan to take those girls up the mountain?
...
I won't let you lay a finger on them.

Very well.
My apologies, I only had enough time to stop by and say hello.
See you later, Mitsue.
I have to head back home and finish editing my videos.
Goodbye.

Home Ec{or whatever a cooking room is called at school}
Tada!
It's done!
Is that some kind of chimera?
It's avant-garde!
Weren't we supposed to be making meatloaf today?
Miss said I could make an extra side!
I guess you could call that a side in some universe...
Do you cook a lot, Miko?
A little.
I make lunch for my brother sometimes.
That's so nice!
Maybe I'll make dessert too.

{8}
And I bet Hana focuses more on the eating part?
Well, actually!
I bake cakes and stuff!
I can see you snacking on it as you go and ending up with a tiny cake!
I do not!
Huh...
I'm no good at cooking, so I'll leave it to you guys. I'll take care of the dishes.
Yeah, you are pretty clumsy.
You'll be fine, just give it a go!
I used to be bad at cooking, but look at me now!
What even is that?

Haha!
Omg!
Hahaha!

What's up?
N-Nothing.
I haven't heard those bells for a few days.
I think Mitsue was right.
{flashback}
I'll take care of your business with the shrine.
You don't have to worry about a thing.{death flag}
You'll be fine as long as you don't go back there.
I-Is this your intuition again?
It's right most of the time.
{flashback end}
I shouldn't stick my nose where it doesn't belong.
Sorry for
the wait.
Then again, I can still see them even if I don't do anything.

{10}
Looking good, everyone!
Meatloaf
If any groups have extra time, you can make some for your homeroom teacher too.
All right, I'm going to make one for Mr. Zen.
What happened to being bad at cooking?
I just remembered I was good at making meatloaf.
I want to knead too!
...
Look, I made a heart!
That's so cringy.
Shut up!
Oh, I know.

{11}
Maybe I'll make some for Mitsue.
It might end up on the smaller side.
Isn't this fun?
I'm gonna make a flower!
Make sure you get all the air out.
You got it!
I should lighten up.
There's no point worrying about it.
I can just have fun cooking with everyone.

Oh my god... Are you serious?

Hey, I have an idea.
We could draw faces on these and make them super cute!
You wanna draw faces? Can't we just write LOVE with ketchup or something?
All it takes is a little extra effort,
and you can cuten up your dish in a flash!
Look!
Cherry tomatoes plus corn equals cute!
Hey, not bad.
Let's do it!
Really?
Yay!

Wow, you're really good at dicing onions.
Isn't your face kinda close?
What did we need onions for?
I-I'm gonna make some sauce.
Do onions really make you cry that much?
I love onion sauce!
All right, we'll leave it to you.

{21}
eeeghh
That was close!
I guess I have to make the sauce.
Should we season it some more?
Just a little is fine.

Staff Room
We made this for you!
You're not going to say it was from Chie?
She said she wanted us to say it was "from all of us".
Oh, right.
Did you wash your hands before cooking?
We had gloves on!
I'll have a little, then.
How is it?
All right.
All right.
We'd better save some for Julia, too.
