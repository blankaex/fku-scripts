Saturday

Miko's in her loungewear...
heheh...{nothin personnel}
Thanks for having us...
Study sesh at Miko's
Come on in guys!
This is my house...

Why are Yurikawa and Niguredou here?
?
I thought I was going to be alone with Miko today.
Hana?
What's with the gigantic backpack?
Don't worry! It's just full of snacks!
Maintaining your blood sugar level is important for studying!
You eat snacks and fill up on sugar,
and your brain uses the sugar to help you study!
Something behind me is giving me shivers...

{3}
I called everyone over to study,
Yotsuya,
would you mind helping Ichijou with her studies?
Huh?
I'd love to study with you, Miko.
Let's go to your house.
but is this really okay?
There's only Kyousuke in the living room.
We should be fine...
{mask}

{4}
Hey, lil' Kyo!
It's your big sis Hana!
Ugh, you again...
What are you here for?
Stay back!
Just here to study.
Hey, where's mom?
She went shopping.
Hey Kyousuke,
is it all right if we study in the living room?
Seriously?
I'm in the middle of a game!

{5}
Can't you just study in your room?
It's so cramped up there, though.
All right, fine.
peek
Miko's brother?
Hello—
What's a grade schooler doing here?
Wanna play Murio Kart?
Julia's a high schooler.
What a brat!
Don't get all uppity just 'cause you're Miko's sister!
I'm way ahead of you in terms of power, and... stuff...
I bet I'm taller, too...

{6}
Hello.
...
She's so long!
Damn, you're so cool!
So long!
Michiru is a model!
Wow, you're famous?
Have you been on Totally Freaky?
I haven't.
What's Totally Freaky?

{7}
What was that?
Oh...
SORRY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL GO TO MY ROOM.
Huh, why? Will you all fit?
I can just move some things around...
...

{8}
There's something there...
clack

{9}
Time to put Godmother's holy bracelet to use!
What did you eat to get that tall?
MD's! Especially the—
Wasn't asking you, Hana.

Hey!
That's the wrong way, Julia!

My room's upstairs!

Quite the crowd we have over today!

{13}
How fun.
Hahaha
Great to see you have lots of friends.
Miko, why are you strangling Julia?
Huh? Oh, sorry! Force of habit!
Are you okay?
...
I guess she wants me to ask permission before exorcising...
I'm okay...

{14}
Why did you come out today, Dad?
huff
Miko sure is popular, huh?
You're always in the tatami room!
But you're my only friend.
Hahaha, just kidding!
...

{15}
Hana, could you take Julia and Michiru up to my room?
I'll get us some drinks.
Hmm?
Let me help!
It's fine! You're my guests!
Why don't you just study down here?
...
What's with the scary look?{nice bubble}
Ever since I started seeing them,
he's been sitting around at home.
I'm already used to Dad being there.

{16}
Maybe "used to" isn't the right way to put it.
Goodnight, Miko.
Miko won't listen to me...
Give her some time.
When I was younger, I would always ignore him after we had a fight.
It's a bit late in the game, but I still don't know how I'm meant to act.
And then there's that...
It's always with him.
huff
It doesn't seem like it's going to do anything,
but I don't think it would be a good idea to let Michiru's tentacles get too close.

{17}
Miko.
I brought you a gift.
It's a pudding.
Pudding
Bewitching richness
Pudding
Sloppy and delicious
You like these, right?
Oh no.

Hey, you know you can't be taking puddings from other...

Huh?
They retracted?
What's wrong Miko?
Huh? Oh!
Nothing! I'm fine!
Thanks for the pudding.
You're welcome.

{24}
Could you wait up in my room?
I'll join you guys soon.
Are you sure you'll be okay?
I'll be fine!
All right, we'll see you soon.
Yeah.
pudding
Greedy boy, aren't we?
You could just study down here.
...

{25}
That scared the heck out of me... I thought Dad was dead for sure...
aahhhhh
What's wrong?
Needa poop?
I mean, he's already dead, but you know...
It's just...
It wouldn't feel right.

Hey Michiru, hold up!
You haven't been over before, right?
I'll show you where Miko's room—
Huh?
Have you been over before?
...
No.
Intuition?
It was just a coincidence, without a moment of hesitation.
