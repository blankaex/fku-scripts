Hey Michiru, I was wondering,
why did you move to our school?
...
Because of work.
Wow, you must be really busy.
That's crazy.
...

Wait!
Does that mean you might leave?
I don't have any plans to.
Thank god!
We only just became friends.
It would be sad if you had to leave.
...
Friends...
Michiru, are you sure you're good for tonight?
What do you mean?
When you were on the phone, your sister—
It's fine.
By the way...

{3}
Where might your father be, Miko?
I'd like to say hello.
Oh, right...
I haven't told you.
My dad's not around anymore.
Well, he kinda is.
He passed away last year.
What?!
Oh.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Huh?
Don't worry about it!

{4}
Wait a minute...
bffhh
Surely not...
It must be tough, Miko.
I know exactly how you feel.
I really do understand.
I knew it. I'm the only one who understands Miko.
You're welcome to talk to me whenever—
I'm fine, really.
Thanks to a cheerful, bubbly someone.{cucked}

{5}
hehe
You're making me blush.

!
Eek!

{8}
What was that? Lightning?
Is there a blackout?
That sounded really close by.
All the neighbor's lights are off too.
It's so dark, I can't see a thing!{Mienai-ko}
Get some candles!
We can just use our phones...
!
Aahh!
A ghost!
Hana, calm down!
It's just Julia...

{9}
Don't scare me like that!
can't.. breathe..
Uhh... Huh?
Why is she mad again?
Aahh!
Stop already!

{10}
Wah!
Aaahh!!
Shut up, Hana...
Can't believe you're scared of thunder.
What are you, a grade schooler?
But damn, it really is dark.
I feel like I'm gonna run into a wall.
I think there were some candles downstairs.

{11}


{12-13}
knock
knock
I guess ghosts are real.

{14}
I found a lantern.
It's LED.{what is the point of this line}{Instead of gas, or candles}
Kyousuke, what's wrong—
Shh!
D-Do-Do
Doodoo?
No!
knock knock knock
Excuse me!
knock knock
Is anyone home?
knock knock

{15}
What? We have a visitor?
Shh!
Huh?{based shroom choker}
Why are you guys standing in the hallway?
!
Miko, be quiet!
!
Eek!
A ghost?!
uegh
!
Hana can see it...
That means...
Michiru!
Are you in there?

{16}
Oh, don't mind me.
We'll be leaving shortly.
But you're drenched!
At least take this towel—
Oh, this is nothing.
Nothing at all compared to the torture of desperately searching for my sister who'd suddenly gone missing.

{17}
If she were staying over at a friend's house, wouldn't you expect their parents to contact you?
When I considered the possibility that she might've been kidnapped, my heart was torn to shreds.{tornposting}
Well, I...
Oh, sorry that's not what I meant!
I know you're just looking after her, and you weren't trying to kidnap her!
That's why I came out to see what the situation was.
I figured that would be best.
...
Umm...
I'm really sorry.
I should've been more insistent—
Step

{18}
Michiru?
Michiru.
Sorry, Miko.
I'll wash your clothes and return them to you.
Huh?
You're leaving? 
It's still pouring out there!
Don't worry.
I've asked the agency to bring a car around.
Thank you for having me.
...

{19}
...
Yotsuya Miko.
Miko, huh?
smirk
I'd better do something about her.

{20}
They could've at least waited until the rain stopped.
...
You didn't do anything wrong, Miko Mom!
Don't worry about it!
Thanks, Hana.
{mask}
But it's my responsibility to make sure her guardian knows where she is.
I can understand why her sister would be so worried.
If Miko or Kyousuke had gone missing,
I'd go looking for them even in a storm like this.

{21}
Aw, Mom...
I-I would too!
I'd rather you didn't.
Shall we all hang out in the living room until the lights come back on?
I made some soup too. Would anyone like some?
{mask}
Yeah, soup! Uh, in the living room!
It'd be dangerous to move about in the dark!
You only care about the soup, don't you?
You know what happens if we don't stay together when it's dark!
People will start going missing one by one!
This isn't a horror movie, Hana.
...

{22}
Thank you for having me.
I couldn't see her face,
but she seemed kind of down.
munch
Is Michiru really gonna be okay?
I'm a bit worried.
Excuse me!

{23}
Is anyone home?
Did she forget something?
knock knock
Hmm...
Better not open it this time.

{24}
Michiru!
Huh?

{25}
Are you in there?
...
That's her sister's voice...
But...

{26}


{27}
Coming!{?}

{28}
Miko!
J-Julia!
She scared me!
What are you doing?
N-Nothing!
Miko, get back here!
You're gonna disappear!
!
C-Coming!

{29}
She already picked Michiru up, so it doesn't make sense she'd be asking for her again.
That was a close one... I need to get it together!
Dad really saved me there...
Hey, Miko?
Huh?
Yeah?
R-Remember before, in the living room?
Was that your dad that I almost exorcised?
!
Oh...
Yeah...
S-Sorry... I should've minded my own business.
I didn't know.
Oh, uhh...
Yeah...
It's fine... I think...
...
Is it?
Huh?

{30}
If everything's fine,
why hasn't he moved on yet?
Oh, uh, sorry! You're the expert! Don't mind me!
Huh? No—
Sorry for running my mouth!
Forget I said anything!
...

{31}
...
Why didn't the thought ever cross my mind?
Looks like the rain is letting up.
Are you cold, Michiru?
Take my blanket.
It's nice and warm!

{32}
{rip main girl and orange hair girl}
I'll make some warm soup when we get back!
With plenty of veggies, just the way you like it!
mumble mumble
{squiggle}
Hana's in trouble.
Dark emotions bubbling up.
