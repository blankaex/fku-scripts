Nurses' Station
The boiler room woman?
Oh, you haven't heard?
You can hear a woman moaning from the boiler room at night.
Wow, really?
Creepy!
That's enough to scare you?
You might want to consider a career change.
We even get nurse calls from empty rooms.
And you can hear footsteps down the hallway at night.
Wheelchair noises, too.
Mieruko-chan
All just rumors, though.

Footsteps and wheelchairs?
Is that so strange?
Yeah, we are in a hospital, after all.
Oh, actually...
I guess you have a point there.
C'mon, chief!
Footsteps and wheelchairs shouldn't be a surprise.
They're totally normal.
I don't even remember what I was scared of.
Okay, that's enough! Back to work!

Oh my god...
What the heck was that?
I managed to escape,
Ahh, I'm busting!
It's back!
but it's not going away.
I don't think it's chasing me.
phew
I guess it's just making the rounds?

I've ended up pretty far from my room.
I just wanted to go to the toilet...

What do I do?

{12}
That's right, I don't need to run...
If I just stand still they'll pass right through me...
...
Right?{MITCHER YOU RUINED HER}

{13}
Oh my god, it's coming!
It's okay!
It'll pass through me! Just stand still! Or should I turn and run? Is this going to work? Will it pass through me? Which way should I go? Wh-What do I do?

{14-15}

Wh-What are you doing here?
Where'd you get that?
Oh this?
It was $30 at Target.
That's not what I meant...
Miss Yotsuya,
the patients' rooms are this way.
Huh?
Can't blame you for being confused, you did hit your head pretty hard.
Huh? What?
But that way's—
It looks like you twisted your ankle.
Could you crouch down so I can have a look?
What? Why?
Crouch down.

{21}
What?

{22-23}


{24}
Oh dear, this looks pretty bad.
We'd best get you treated right away.
Wait wait wait wait...
Can you walk?
