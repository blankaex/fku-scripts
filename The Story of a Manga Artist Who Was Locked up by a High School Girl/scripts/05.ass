It's been a few days since I've been locked up.
I'm starting to remember bits and pieces from before my confinement.
This is actually my own apartment.
I only just moved in recently, so I wasn't really familiar with it.
So that means I'm being locked up in my own house, by a schoolgirl that I've never met before.

02
How is it?
I-It's okay, I guess.
...
What's the matter?
I just felt a bit like I was mooching off you.
Oh.
Don't worry about that.

03
I'm paying from our joint bank account.
Oh also, someone tried to pay some royalties so I went ahead and signed it off.
What do you mean our joint account? This is my bankbook...
Wait, how do you know my pin?

04
It's not a great idea to use your birthday as your bank pin,
especially f you're going to make it public on social media.
Anyway, I'm going shopping.
If anyone's reading this, heed my advice.
Don't use your birthday as your bank pin. Even if you don't share your birthday on social media.
That's all I ask.
