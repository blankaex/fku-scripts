I don't know what would have happened without you.
You were amazing.
Simple words, lasting impression.

Enigma Syndrome
Haunted Bus Tour
Greetings, my wonderful members!
I'm your host, Shindou Romm!
I've been looking forward to meeting all of you.
I hope you all enjoy today's tour.
omigosh it's Romm!
It's like he has some kind of aura about him.
Right?
...

{5}
This Shindou Romm guy...
I'll give you all my signature later!
Only 10,000 Power per person!
Hahaha!
Is super shady...
But his videos weren't fake.
I need to find out how strong he is.
If he's the real deal, then he might be able to help me train.
I put on this disguise so that no one would realize I'm not an adult,
but these platform shoes are really hard to walk in...
I watch all your videos!
Why, thank you!

{6}
People like to call this place the "Ribbit Frog Pond".
Broken-hearted women commit suicide by jumping into the pond, and their souls linger... or something like that.
It's a cursed pond that even the locals steer clear of.
Everyone okay?
Is anyone sensitive enough to feel something here?
Now that you mention it, I do feel a bit of a chill...
I can feel someone looking at me!
There's definitely something here...
Yeah, for sure.
I can hear a woman sobbing.
Am I the only one?

{7}
I would expect no less from members of the Enigma Syndrome. Your senses are so sharp!
...
What the heck are these people even talking about?
I'm getting the chills...
I don't feel a thing.
Fear not.
I posses a special item that will ward away evil spirits.
Here it is.
Brimming with power!
It's salt!
Compressed into a tight space, this small bottle of salt is practically brimming with power!
It will protect you from any vengeful spirits.

{8}
Normally I'd sell these for 10,000 Power (Yen), but I have a special price just for my members.
For only 8,000 Power (Yen), you can have your very own bottle of salt!
I'll take three!{meme but good}
Me too!
What?
Salt?!
The spirits are fading away...
Huh?
Seriously?
Now I'm safe.
Romm is amazing.
Is he just a scam artist?
No, wait... That video was real...
Maybe this is real too...
I don't have any money...

{9}
Time to head to the next haunted location.
Let's go...st!
Let's ghost!
Here's our next spot. It's called "The Haunted House".
The family committed suicide together, but rumor has it they've remained here to this very day.
I can feel them inside.
What an ominous aura.
I just saw a shadow move on the second floor!
I saw it too!

{10}
There's a really pale child!
I can hear a cat!
Uhh...
What about the whole bunch next door?

{11}
It's said that you'll fall victim to the curse if you enter the house.
Scary thought, isn't it?
But no need to worry.
I have this charm, brimming with power!
As long as you hold one of these, you'll be able to dispel any curse that comes your way.
By all means, please purchase one if you'd like to go inside.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience a curse first-hand.
One for me, please!
Me too!
I don't feel a thing from this house.
And how come no one's noticed everything going on next door?
It's amazing to be surrounded by so many powerful mediums!
I'm still a long ways away.
Oh dear, there's one on your shoulder.
Huh?
There you go, I've just exorcised it.

{12}
Wow, really?
That's amazing!
Indeed. There were three of them.
Three?!
Do you enjoy scaring people like that?
You think you're some kind of girl that sees them?
You're such a freak.
Everyone's just a fake or here for fun.
Let's take a haunted selfie!
You're gonna get cursed!
I can see a woman on all fours!
It's all their fault that everyone treated me horribly.
...

{13}
The "Cursed Hospital"!
This Holy Power Ring is all you need.
It will keep the spirit of the head nurse at bay, and—
The "Cursed Curb"!
All you need to do is hold onto this Spirit-Repelling Keychain.
Anything that comes at you in a car will be forcibly—
The "Cursed Observation Deck"
Just put on these Sunglasses of Light.
These will protect you from lingering spirits _and_ UV rays—

{14}
And this is the final destination for today's tour.
It's called the "Cursed Canyon".
A woman was murdered here, and her body was thrown into this canyon.
Her spirit still dwells about this bridge, looking for the person that killed her... I think.
I can see a woman's figure...
I can hear a faint crying voice...
This is such a sad location.
It's said that those who hear her voice are dragged down into the depths of hell.
But these Anti-Curse Earplugs can protect you from that fate.
2,000 Power.

{15}
Now then, one at a time. Be careful, it's an old bridge.
What a joke.
sigh...
{mask}
Some earplugs?
No thanks.
It's not safe out there, you know?
I guess that video was fake.
He's just a swindler that gathered everyone to get his hands on their money.
People like him give real mediums a bad name.

{18}
Huh?
Why did it explode open again?
Ah!

{19}
Huh?
No way...

Huh?

{20}
Oh dear.
Didn't I warn you?
It's not safe out here.

{21}
Whoa!
Th...
Thank...
Thank you...
Are you hurt?
Power Stones
It's those stones!

{22}
Oh?
I recognize these.
crack

Oh dear.
The stones are splitting in half on their own?
I think we need to hurry.
Huh?
If you'll excuse me.

{23}
sob
sob
Hey, wait!
Hold on tight, okay?
!
There's something here?
It wasn't just my imagination?
Who is he?

{24}
Thank you all for coming today.
This marks the end of today's haunted tour.
I have some Power Buns for sale, if anyone would like a souvenir.
By all means, take some for the road.
3,000 Power.
Huh? Was the salt always this black?
These sunglasses are great!
I can just feel the power!
I've lost track of how many I exorcised today.
My ring's broken...
My ears are all sticky...
What the heck?
Thank you so much for this wonderful tour, Romm!
There was definitely something there when my holy bracelet snapped.
Could there be other things around that I just can't see?

{25}
Here you go, I fixed it for you.
This is Godmother's holy bracelet, isn't it?
Huh?
How did you know?
I can feel it.
Mrs. Mitsue is an old friend of mine.
He's friends with Godmother?
He's the real deal after all!
My name is Niguredou Julia!
I'm Godmother's top disciple!

{26}
Her top disciple?
Really, now...
Why did you come on the tour today?
Does Mrs. Mitsue know about this?
Oh, I haven't been able to see her lately.
I just happened to see one of your videos, so I signed up on your website.
I thought you were a scam artist at first, but I'm so relieved that you're not!
I wish she'd say that a bit more quietly...
I want to get stronger.
I want to become a real medium, like you and Godmother.
A real, strong medium.

{27}
...
Oh you do, do you?
Please teach me!
But of course.
You're welcome any time.
...
A real medium, huh?
{mask}
Doesn't look like any of them were around today either.

{28}
The salt and earplugs look to have worked.
The ring as well.
Sunglasses could use some work.
sob
look

I'll need to get some more stones, too.

look at me
Bringing those girls here might be the fastest way after all.{Is it really "here"? I read that as that particular bridge.}
sob

Free consultation.
Godmother of
Fortune Telling and Exorcism
Your luck with money, work, love
all raised to the max!

- Godmother Mitsue
Oh, Mrs. Mitsue isn't home?
I was hoping she could help me figure out what's going on with Hana.
rustle
...
Hello? Hana?
How are you feeling?
I'm great!
Do you want some butt buns?
Sure do!
Butt buns can't hurt.
What is Romm trying to stir up?
