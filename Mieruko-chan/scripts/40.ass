Oka Towa—
...
Mieruko-chan
Did you see her?{meet}
Yeah.
I hope you got to say your farewells.
It wasn't really the right place to sit back and chat about old times.
There was barely even any time to blink.
It's a long story.
Sticking to her principles, as she did in life.

{2}
Romm and I searched for years and never found her.
She was more concerned with helping people than saying goodbye to her apprentice.
Can't believe her.
What a hero.
Ain't she?
That's why I became her apprentice.
Are we still harboring ill will against Romm?
A lot has happened between us these past few decades.
I guess I started letting him start calling himself my apprentice.
You're such a tsundere.

{3}
Why don't you go make up with your apprentice too?
...
Maybe if he comes to apologize.
You don't even remember what you're upset about.
You tsundere.
Has he been doing all right?
Yeah, he's been putting that hoe to work.
Maybe if we get back together, I could find a time to make up with him.
You and your stupid beard can both fuck off.
But you're going back out to the sticks, right?
No.
There might be another time
when this withered hag might be needed again.

{4}
Good morning, class.
Let me introduce you all.
This is the new transfer student.
Her name is...{lmao}

{5}
I'm Ichijou Michiru.
Pleasure to meet you all.
Hello!
She's so hot!
Hey Michiru!
Memorize the transfer student's name at least!
I wonder which school's uniform that is.
...
Oh, she's joining our class!

{6}
Have a seat.
I guess I'm the only one that can see a monster,
and everyone else sees her as a person?
When I bumped into her earlier,
it did feel like bumping into a person.
What am I supposed to do?

{7}
Hello.
Miko Goggles
Uh.
Hey.
You're being kinda rude, Miko. What's wrong?
Mm...

{8}
I guess I should just treat her like a normal person?
Hey,
sorry for bumping into you earlier...
I'm... Yotsuya Miko...
Eye contact, eye contact.
Where the heck are her eyes?

{9}
I'm Yurikawa Hana! Just call me Hana!
Nice to meet you, Michiru!
Hello.
Nice to meet you, Yotsuya. Yurikawa.
I'm telling you, she is!
Look!
Omg!
It's Mitcher!
She's Chaos Teen's in-house model!

{10}
Whoa, you're a model?
That's so cool!
I feel like I've seen you before!
Your curves are so sexy!
Your hair is so pretty too!
Is it okay if I touch?
No!
You shouldn't just... do that... all of a sudden...

{11}
What's wrong, Miko?
Uh...
I mean... it's her first day...
M-Miko's right! She's not here for show!
Buzz off, everyone!
Didn't you start this, Chie?
School's part of her personal life, right?
We should just be friends with her.
You know, friends?
Are you trying to get a referral for her agency or something?
{mask}
I'm not!
It was written all over your face...
All right, back to your seats everyone.
It's time for class.
Your hair is so pretty too!

{12}
Is it okay if I touch?
Was that because she tried to touch her hair?
This girl might be bad news...

{13}
Lunch time!
Let's buy out the cafeteria!
Oh, Michiru! Do you wanna grab lunch with us?
!
Hey, Mitcher!
Wanna eat with us?
What do you usually eat? Are you on a diet?

{14}
Sorry,
Yotsuya already asked.
Maybe next time.
I didn't invite you!
Could you show me the way?
The pastries at the cafeteria are the best!

{15}
Cafeteria
Red Bean Bun
Fried Cream & Sugar
Choc-chip Curry Danish
Whoa, there's so many new ones!
Very innovative...
What do I do? Should I just get all of them?
I feel like it'd be better to stay away from her,
but getting on her bad side is probably a bad idea too.
How about one of these, Michiru?
I love these!

{16}
This one especially!
It's so good!
wtf?
W-Why is it going after Hana too?
!
Caterpillar Crossaint

{17}
This one's not too bad either.
And this one's also pretty good.
How—
rustle
How about this one?
Caterpillar
Come on, Miko, that's not enough for—
It's so cute...

{18}
Thank you, Yotsuya.
I'll get this.
N-No problem.
I guess size _doesn't_ matter.
Excuse me! Could I get two of each of these, please?
And this one, and this one—
Phew, it's back to normal...
I can't see her face but I can kind of tell what she's thinking by her, uh, tentacles?
I'll have to be careful to not get her worked up.
I don't know what it might do.
Hey, Julia!
You didn't bring your own lunch today?
I thought I might come to the cafeteria once in a—

{19}
She's so long...
Oh, let me introduce you. This is Ichijou Michiru!
She just joined our class today.
Oh, the transfer student everyone's been talking about.
Uh, hello. I'm Niguredou Julia.
Nice to meet you, Niguredou.

{21}
I forgot they were around too...

Hmm... I think there's something next to Miko.
I've been training off Romm's videos lately.
Enigma!
Shindou Romm!

{24}
By the way, Michiru.
Is that bun all you're going to eat?
...
I'm a light eater.
Oh, I guess you are a model.
Watching your diet must be tough.
{mask}
She exorcised it just by looking at it?!{god this stupid autist}
glare
fizzle

{25}
I need to go talk to Mrs Mitsue or Romm.
Maybe after school.

{26}
Yep
All right
clack clack
Hahaha
clack clack
There we go, that's the last of them.
It's a breeze, you just need to rile them up a little.
Hello, thanks for the superchat!

Romm's Game Room
Romm's the coolest!
He's so good
Suck it, nerd
He's a pad player?
Yeah, work's been pretty busy lately,
so this has been a pretty good break from things.
I stream games from time to time, so feel free to drop by.
Don't forget to subscribe to my main channel as well!

Until next time.

Hello? Shindou Romm speaking.
...
Yes,
I'm fine now.
...
Right.
Okay.

{28}
This sounds like a job.
Please, I'd love to hear the details.
I'd like to start by investigating the area.
jingle
Hmm? A bell?
Oh, that's just the cat.
It sometimes stops by.
Hahaha

{29}
Hahaha, no need for concern.
Danger comes with the territory, after all.

{30}
Mrs Mitsue wasn't home,
and I don't know Romm's number.
I guess I'll have to try another day.
It's Chaos Teen.
Hmm...
flip
I still can't see her face.

{31}
...
Let's just head home.

{32}
I had a great day today, Pii.
Do you want to hear about it?
I made a new friend!
Her name is Yotsuya Miko.
She showed me a bun that looked just like you!

{33}
She had a Meme strap too.
Lolol
I can't believe she likes Lolol too, we have so much in common!
And when someone tried to touch my hair,
she yelled at them to stop.
It was almost as if she knew I didn't like being touched.
When I met her this morning,
she looked straight at me,
and dived straight into my arms.
I thought she was one of my fans at first, but I was wrong.
She's so mysterious. Nobody looks at me the way she does.
It was like she could see right through me,
but she wasn't even looking at me.

{34}
I've never felt like this before...

ngh..
Miko has a nightmare.
Miko interprets everything in a good light, but the fear is drawing closer.
