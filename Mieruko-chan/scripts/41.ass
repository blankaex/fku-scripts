Only I can see the transfer student's true form
{you're on your own for the rest}

Observing your model closely
is the key to portrait drawing.
Use your eyes well.

{3}
How am I meant to draw a portrait of this?
{mask}

{4}
You can just relax, Ichijou.
Thanks!
{mask}
Sure.
Ain't this a banger!
Who'da thunk we'd have Chiruru modeling for us?
"I wish I picked music as my elective"
"art is boring af"
I never said that...

{5}
Hey, you two!
Quit chatting!
Sorry...
Yotsuya Miko...
Miko...
She's avoiding eye contact again.
I would really love to know why.
I feel like she's looking at me...

{6}
She's tangible, unlike all the other ones,
Hello Miko.
Good morning.
O-Oh, hey!
Nice weather today!
It's cloudy.
so I can't just ignore her.
But I can't see what she actually looks like,
which makes things pretty difficult.
Hmm...
Oh right, I can just copy what Hana's drawing.

{7}
All right!
Hana, your apple is too big!
Chiruru won't fit!
Just Hana being Hana...
Oh, very good.
You've captured the texture of the apple really well.
Hehe.
But you can't just take a quick look.
It's important to observe and understand the motif as well.
Try to focus on more than just the apple.
Hehe...
...

{8}
"It's important to observe and understand"
She might be right. I've never really had the chance to take a good look.
Maybe this is a good opportunity.
Miko closed her eyes.
What an interesting girl.
Oh Miko.
Why won't you look my way?

{9}
Chiruru really looks like a doll when she's just sitting still.
Unlike you, Chie. You fumble about even when you're sitting.
Excuse me? I do not!

{10}
Her eyelashes are so long.
Her tentacles are so long.
How many does she have?
One, two, three...
Kind of like an octopus, maybe?
Damn.
What am I even drawing?
Miko's perspective.
Huh?
The tentacles are moving.
They're wrapping around her head?

{11}
{time to get romm's ghostbusting outfit back}

{12}
Huh?

{13}
{There's }Eyes...
drip

{14}
Wow Shiho, you're good at this!
Well she is in the art club.
Huh?
Lemme see!
!
...
Damn!
It looks just like her!
I-I wanna see too...{meme font}
Watching her might have been a bad idea...

{15}
Whoa!
So that's how she sees her.
!
What do you mean?
O-Oh nothing, I just thought it was a good drawing.

{16}
What the heck is this, Miko?
Fried octopus?
Hey!
I-It's nothing,
I was just sketching...
...
That's not how you draw a portrait...
You're meant to draw what you see, as-is..
You can't just make it all abstract like that...
I would've done it differently if I weren't doing a portrait...
Why does Shiho look so attacked?
Come on, back to your seats everyone.
ding dong
Oh...
I guess that's it for today.
Done!

{17}
My apple!
It's so good.
Yurikawa.
Hmm?
You can have the apple.
Huh?
Really? You sure?
plop
Yay, thanks!
...
I'd love to see your portrait, Miko.

{18}
N-No! Sorry!
I'm really bad at drawing!
Sorry!
I was going to use that apple with my next class.
?
Forget it, you can have it.{can't beat the hana}
Th-That was close...

{19}
{hands ðŸ‘€}

{20}
Intense eye contact with Miko!{damn this sounds like an /a/ shitpost}
{split/mask somehow}
This is so strange. My body feels like it's on fire.
What could it be? What could it be?
Miko...

{21}
I want to get to know her better.{what the fuck}
I want to get along with her better.
She's eating a pencil!

{22}
Hello, Niguredou.

{23}
Umm...
Hello...
Huh?
Hey!
Huh?
Ah!
Hey!
Aahh!
clack{rip julia}

{24}
{shroomlet bullying hours}

{25}
Shall we have a little chat?

{26}
I hope Mrs. Mitsue is home tomorrow.
How come I didn't see you at lunch today, Julia?
I wasn't feeling too good.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You should eat more meat!
...
Just my imagination?
Actually, why did I even check?

{27}
It's Miko's house.
Oh no.
There's no end to her warped passion.
