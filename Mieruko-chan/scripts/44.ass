Nurse Station
The boiler room woman?
Oh, you haven't heard?
You can hear a woman moaning from the boiler room at night.
Wow, really?
Creepy!
That's enough to scare you?
You might want to consider a career change.
We even get nurse calls from empty rooms.
And you can hear footsteps down the hallway at night.
Wheelchair noises, too.
Mieruko-chan
All just rumors, though.

Footsteps and wheelchairs?
Is that so strange?
We are in a hospital, after all.
Oh, actually...
I guess you have a point there.
C'mon, chief!
Yeah, now that you mention it...
Footsteps and wheelchairs shouldn't be a surprise.
I don't even remember what I was scared of.{TLC: I don't think this is the same nurse as above.}
Okay, that's enough! Back to work!

Oh my god...
What the heck was that?
I managed to get away,
Ahh, I'm busting!
It's back!
but it's not going anywhere.{it's not leaving any time soon}{TLC: Don't really get what you're saying. It literally just went somewhere and left.}
I don't think it's chasing me.
phew
I guess it's just doing the rounds?

I've ended up pretty far from my room.
I just wanted to go to the toilet...
...
screeeeeech
Again?

The nurse station should be just up ahead!
I should head that way for now!

Not the path to the nurse station!{alt: Why...}
Yep, guess I'll head back this way—

{11}
Oh no...
I've been pincered!
N-Not good...
gnash
What do I do?

{12}
That's right, I don't need to run...
If I just stand still they'll pass right through me...
...
Right?{MITCHER YOU RUINED HER}

{13}
Oh my god, it's coming!
I'll be fine!
It'll pass through me! Just stand still! Or should I turn and run? Is this going to work? Will it pass through me? Which way should I go? Wh-What do I do?

{14-15}
I can't hold it any longer!{OOH I'M GONNA BUST}{tfw izumi made the pissposting canon}
Not the wheelchair! I'd rather go this way!
Where's the...
Toilet...
I have to push through!
Toilet!
Quickly!

{16}
Eek!
Mmh!
Ah!

{17}
Whoa there!
!
Be careful.
You shouldn't be running in slippers.
!
It's a person!
Th-
Thank you...
Oh?

{18}
Well if it isn't my good friend Miko!
Good evening.
!
Romm?
The one and only.

{19}
Wh-What are you doing here?
Where'd you get that?
Oh this?
Walmart, $30.
That's not what I meant...
Miss Yotsuya,
the patients' rooms are this way.
Huh?
Can't blame you for being confused, you did hit your head pretty hard.
Huh? What?
But that way's—
It looks like you twisted your ankle.
Could you crouch down so I can have a look?
What? Why?
Get down.

{20}


{21}
What?

{22-23}


{24}
Oh dear, this looks pretty bad.
We'd best get you treated right away.
Wait wait wait wait...
Can you walk?

Wait wait wait...
