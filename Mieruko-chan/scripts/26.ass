They're all frauds.
They've been popping up a lot lately.
You can really tell the difference
once you've seen the real thing.

I picked up all the beads and restrung my holy bracelet.{Is this Julia saying this, or commentary?}
Who am I to call them frauds?
I'm practically one myself.
No! I'm not like them!
Spider!

Miko has amazing powers.{word this up a little to make it sound extravagant}
But she chooses to keep them a secret.
They do say a skilled hawk hides its talons.

Hana boasts a tremendous life aura and isn't even aware of it.
She has the ability to replenish her aura by eating.
What about me?
What do I have?

If I could train properly under Godmother's guidance...
Maybe one day...
I could stand alongside them...
*Just her imagination
N-Not like I care!
I didn't want to anyway!
Good morning everybody!
Oh, it was on autoplay.
Looks like another fraudulent exorcist.
I'll just leave a dislike and go to bed.

I'm Shindou Romm, the Enigma Syndrome!
Good day!
Huh?
Good evening?
How are we all?
Can everyone see what I have inside this glass?

Well, never mind that for now.
I've got a magic trick for you all today!
Chat
looks like a scam
wtf, you just wanted to show a magic trick?

It's a tiny old guy!
He's the real deal?
Is this live?
Chat
this is pretty fishy
yeah, I totally see it
I don't see anything
>never mind that
hurry up and show us the magic trick
your stream sucks you piece of shit
I just happen to have this perfectly normal power stone.
Watch as I make it go through the glass!
I've practiced this trick quite a lot,
but it's pretty nerve-wracking to do it live!
I leave the stone on top of the glass,
and throw this handkerchief over the top.

Enigma Illusion!
...
Now then,
let's take a look!

And would you look at that!
Please send me some super chats.

Hey Sis, where you headed?
Huh?
Oh, uh... I'm going shopping with Hana.
But you said we were gonna watch Totally Freaky.
Oh, sorry.
When I get back, okay?
Sure, I guess...
How about I buy you something?
I don't need anything.
I'll just be playing games.{same}

Sorry, I'm busy
Hana
Oh, I see

I need to keep Hana out of all of this.
I can just visit the shrine on my own.
I hope they don't mind fried tofu.
I'm so nervous.

Huh?
Did this place always look like this?
Maybe I got the wrong entrance.
Oh, maybe not. Maps says I'm in the right spot.
I really hope nothing bad happens.

I'll just quickly leave my offering and head home.
