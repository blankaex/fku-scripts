{1}
I recognize this.

Mieruko-chan
Romm had this.
squeak squeak{ch34 p26, ch34 p33}
Looks like we're back outside.
Huh? The shrine's gone?
The barrier broke down.
That's probably why we were sent out.
The shrill ringing of the bells fades away.

{2}
There was something inside,
st was like, enshrined or something,
so like,
I went to pick it up,
but it was like, a human skull, and I was so scared,
I dropped it,
and it broke,
then everything went all white,
and then—
Miko!

{3}
You're fine.
You did great.

{4}
{mask}
sniff
You don't need to hold it in anymore.
Sorry you had to go through that.
Miko can see them,
but at the end of the day, she's just an ordinary girl.
Yeah,
you really are a strong girl.

{5}
Sorry, I just didn't know what to do.
Nobody does.
That's just what that shrine is like.
By the way,
where's Romm?
...
This way.

{6}
Long time, no see.
It's Shindou Romm.
Do you remember me?
I was just a little boy the last time we met.
About yay high.
The passage of time is a cruel beast, isn't it?
Hahaha
...
Sorry.
That wasn't a very appropriate joke.

{7}
Just how long have you been waiting here?
Years?
Decades? Centuries?
Waiting,
for someone to hear your voice.

{8}
That's...
The girl from the shrine...
...

{9}
Do you remember my wish?
Please,
let me help you.
Will you grant it for me this time?

{10-11}


{12-13}


{14}


{15}
Master!
Huh?
Ms. Towako!{mrs?}


{16}

{17}


{18}


{19}
If I hadn't wandered up the mountain all those years ago,
Ms. Towako might have been help someone out at this very moment.
...
But if you hadn't wandered up the mountain all those years ago,
we wouldn't have been able to save Miko today.
Romm,
did you see my master's face?

{20}
She was smiling.
...
She was.

{21}
Um... Can we just leave like that?
Like...
I kind of broke the skull and stuff...
And the shrine fell apart and everything...
It was an impressive demolition.
Quiet, you!
We all made it back safe and sound.
Well done, Miko.

{22}
...
There was Miko, Hana,
Mrs. Mitsue, and Ms. Towako.
I wouldn't have been able to accomplish any of this by myself.
I was only able to help that girl thanks to everyone's help.
Who was that girl?
A sacrifice?
Who knows?
That mountain doesn't have much literature to its name anymore.

{23}
There's only one thing I know for certain.
She was calling out for help.
Romm.
You need to learn to ask for help yourself.
I'm your master.
You can count on me.
...
I thought you didn't have any apprentices.

{24}
I christened you Shindou Romm.
Can't do much about that now.
...
You never asked me to reciprocate.
Should I start calling you "Godmother"?
Call me Mrs. Mitsue, you dolt.
If Hana's not in danger anymore,
squeeze
then I should just leave it at that.

{25}
Man, I'm beat.
Why don't we stop by Benny's?
I'd better not, my family would worry.
Ah, all right.
I'll take you up on that offer, Master.
You pay for your own meal.

{26}
?
What was that?
There's something there.

{27}
Mmh!
What a wonderful morning!
Morning, Hana.
Hey Miko!
What do we have here?

{28}
The heck is this?
Lambda Rabbit?
Yeah.
I found it.
Isn't it cute?
Uh...
It's kinda scary...
This is proof that I made it out of that shrine.
I stuffed it with the stone that Romm gave me.
It's a good luck charm.

{29}
You know, I've been thinking lately,
one of my Lambda Rabbits looks a bit different...{did we abbreviate this before?}
This one.
*gulp*
She's a sharp one, this Lambda Rabbit weeb.
Looks the same to me!
Anyway let's get to class!
Hey, don't push!
I'm gonna fall!
Everything worked out okay at the shrine,
but I need to be ready for anything.
Sheesh!
Haha, sorry.

Oh yeah, I found this scrumptious-looking bun earlier!{the hell is up with her bag straps}

{31}
{mask right}
No, not this one...
And one's already showed up...
Oh no, it's coming this way!
It's so close!

This is nothing compared to the shrine.
I'll be fine.
It won't run into Hana if it keeps going this way.
Deep breath.
I'll—

{32}
!
Thump?

{33}
?{taking camera angle lessons from the anime I see}
Miko, are you okay?
Uh...
Yeah!
You gotta watch where you're going.
What?
Yep. Looking.
Only forward.
Nothing else. Yep.
Why are you talking like that?
What just happened?
I thought I would just go through them.
Did I bump into a pillar?
No, it didn't feel like concrete at all...
Miko, you should apologize for bumping into her.
Huh?

{34}
No,
it was my fault.
????
Wtf?

{35}
Sorry, Miko's such a klutz.
Hana can see it?
!
H-Hana!
Whoa!
Huh?
We need to get outta here!
huff
Miko!
Stop!
Miko?
Miko!
Come on, I know you love me,
but you can't get all jealous
the moment I start talking to another pretty girl.
Huh?
What?
Is that the transfer student?
What a babe!

{36}
Wow, she's so pretty!
And tall!
"Transfer student".
All I see is a monster...
Boom, headshot.
